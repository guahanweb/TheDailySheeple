<p><a href="http://saf.org">The Second Amendment Foundation</a> secured a leaked copy of the Democrats&#8217; gun control playbook.  The title of the 70+ page document is <a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gun-ViolenceMessaging-Guide-PDF-1.pdf"><em>Preventing Gun Violence Through Effective Messaging</em></a><em>.</em>
	</p>
<p>The instructions provide insight into just how politicians and anti-gunners are organizing themselves strategically to be on the same page in order to attack pro-gun supporters, pro-gun organizations such as the <a href="http://www.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> and <a href="http://gunowners.org">Gun Owners of America</a>, and even how to politicize national shooting tragedies to push their agenda for more control of the people who own guns.
</p>
<p>Dave Workman <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/there-is-a-gun-control-playbook-versus-washington-gun-owners">informs us</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The 70-plus page guide, produced last year and posted on-line as a pdf by <a href="http://www.tbe.org/index.aspx" target="_blank">Temple Beth El</a> though a link no longer appears on the TBE website, is titled <em>Preventing Gun Violence through Effective Messaging</em>. It offers tips on everything from using effective rhetoric to dividing <a href="http://www.nra.org/" target="_blank">National Rifle Association </a>members from NRA leadership. One of the people who prepared the guide was Al Quinlan, a principle of the Washington, D.C.-based firm of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner (GQR), which also has offices in London and Buenos Aires.
</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.pdc.wa.gov/rptimg/default.aspx?batchnumber=100529077" target="_blank">PDC report </a>filed by the Seattle-based Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility (WAGR) shows a May expense of $43,700 paid to GQR for opinion research.
</p>
<p>According to the guide, Quinlan was part of &#8220;a team of communicators&#8221; with &#8220;decades of experience advising organizations on message development and strategic communications.&#8221; Other members of this team were Frank O&#8217;Brien, creative director and founder of<a href="http://www.ompdirect.com/" target="_blank"> OMP</a>, another Washington, D.C.-based firm, and Jeff Neffinger and Matthew Kohut at <a href="http://knpcommunications.com/" target="_blank">KNP Communications</a>, also headquartered in Washington, D.C.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In using national tragedies, such as the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in December 2012, the document states that &#8220;The most powerful time to communicate is when concern and emotions are running at their peak &#8230; The debate over gun violence in America is periodically punctuated by high-profile gun violence incidents including Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, the Trayvon Martin killing, Aurora and Oak Creek. When an incident such as these attracts sustained media attention, it creates a unique climate for our communications efforts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gun control playbook also suggests using &#8220;emotionally powerful language&#8221; to push the gun control agenda.  The architects want readers to take on semi-automatic weapons by declaring &#8220;These weapons are not your grandfather&#8217;s rifle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That argument is easily defeated by an even more intense, emotional argument, &#8220;They are your son&#8217;s rifle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The document then deals with the controversial (at least among liberals) Stand Your Ground laws and addresses it in provocative terms on page 45, such as &#8220;Shoot First&#8221; and &#8220;Kill at Will,&#8221; claiming that these phrases are &#8220;more accurate and persuasive.&#8221;  Nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>There is also a suggestion not to use certain phrases, such as &#8220;duty to retreat.&#8221;  Why?  It&#8217;s because the term may have established legal principle, but it conveys weakness to the public and is &#8220;hard to defend.&#8221;  In fact, in Washington State, there are court rulings that date nearly 100 years back that have clearly stated that there is &#8220;no duty to retreat&#8221; if one is being attacked in a place where they have a right to be.
</p>
<p>Oh, and the document knowingly wants to avoid facts, except in the case where such manipulated facts help the case.  &#8220;Use a few facts—but only in a way that reinforces the personal frame—not as a recitation of a list of facts without the connection to the personal anguish and loss.&#8221;  They don&#8217;t want to look at the <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/01/pulling-back-the-lefts-demonizing-of-the-modern-musket-real-numbers-of-violent-crime-in-the-us/">real numbers</a> in violent crime, as this would defeat their arguments.
</p>
<p>Finally, the document encourages citation of &#8220;law enforcement&#8217;s support at every opportunity.&#8221;  Just remember not to mention certain individuals and groups such as the <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/05/54-co-sheriffs-file-federal-lawsuit-over-new-gun-laws/">Colorado Sheriff&#8217;s Association</a> (including <span style="color:black; background-color:white">Elbert County Colorado Sheriff <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/04/shayne-heap-co-sheriff-calls-out-obama-after-political-grandstanding-in-denver/">Shayne Heap</a>)</span>, or Milwaukee Sheriff <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/01/wi-sheriff-david-clarke-tells-residents-you-have-a-duty-to-protect-yourself-your-family/">David Clarke</a>, or maybe some <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/01/oregon-sheriffs-blast-biden-we-wont-let-you-turn-citizens-into-criminals-with-unconstitutional-actions-by-misguided-politicians/">Oregon sheriffs</a>, or <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/02/ga-sheriff-no-one-is-coming-to-our-state-to-violate-the-second-amendment/">some</a> Georgia <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/01/sheriff-pulls-business-from-dana-safety-supply-because-they-stopped-selling-semi-automatic-rifles-to-civilians/">sheriffs</a>.  After all,  they are just the guys on the ground without a political agenda.
</p>
<p>The side of freedom is often spoken of as being manipulated by the gun lobby.  The truth of the matter is that the gun lobby exists because of those who are liberty minded, not the other way around.  The Second Amendment was in place long before there was an NRA or a GOA.  Perhaps this document could rightly be called &#8220;<em>Gun Control Indoctrination:  How to Criminalize Gun Ownership through Effective Messaging</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It Doesn&#8217;t Make Sense.  Our leaders aren&#8217;t stupid. They may be foolish, they may be corrupt, but they aren&#8217;t stupid.
</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a Democrat phenomenon. It didn&#8217;t start with President Obama&#8217;s occupation of the White House. This is a manifestation of the Dualocracy: the regime of the government party, that great two headed Hydra wherein the Democrat and Republican Parties are merely two heads on the same bird of prey.
</p>
<p>When we look at the current direction our country is going in many people say, &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221; I hear this or a variation of it all the time. We see laws, regulations, and programs spewing forth from Chicago on the Potomac on a daily basis that just don&#8217;t add up.

<blockquote><p>Why would our government spend us into the poorhouse? Borrow more money than anyone could ever pay back? Create money out of thin air like Weimar Republic? Pass Healthcare reform to insure millions that&#8217;s really a tax, is almost incomprehensible even to those who supposedly wrote it, and doesn&#8217;t insure anyone? Why would we help overthrow our friends to empower our enemies? Why do we look for ways to legalize illegals now and make promises about securing the border in the future? Why? Why? Why?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense.
</p>
<p>The problem is these people are too smart and their organizations are too well-oiled to do so much that is nonsensical. I don&#8217;t believe the problem is that they are from Bizarro World or that they are political savants. I believe we are not looking at what is happening in and to our country in the proper context.
</p>
<p>Much like a person who needs glasses: if the lenses aren&#8217;t right everything looks blurry or distorted. So too when we look at the actions of intelligent people who are operating with a grand design of how they want the world to be and nothing makes any sense: we need some new lenses. The problem most Tea Party types have understanding what our dear leaders are doing is that we think they should be trying to preserve the America we received from our forefathers. We look at their actions, and they seem like the theater of the absurd.
</p>
<p><strong>Who would do what they do if they want what we want? </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the key. They don&#8217;t want what we want.</strong> </p>
<blockquote><p>We want to preserve our heritage and they want to fundamentally transform the United States of America. We believe the Constitution recognizes what the Declaration of Independence calls our &#8220;unalienable rights&#8221; and it is a good thing to limit government from having the power to violate those rights. Our Progressive masters bemoan the fact that the Constitution only gives negative rights which limit the power of the central government. They dream instead of a second bill of rights which bestows upon the central government and its mammoth bureaucracy a mandate to legislate, regulate, and strangulate us into their vision of utopia.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with any Utopia is that it&#8217;s always based upon coercion. People must be forced to do what some all-knowing god-like central authority decides is the way to achieve perfection. From Plato&#8217;s Republic to Sir Thomas More&#8217;s Utopia from Aldous Huxley&#8217;s Brave New World to Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s Piano Player the visions of a perfect society herded and regimented by an all-powerful government will always end up as some dystopian reflection of George Orwell&#8217;s 1984.
</p>
<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but perfection will never happen in this life. We are imperfect people living in an imperfect world. God has endowed us with certain rights and without them it is not possible to be all that we are meant to be. The only way to ensure them is to limit governments from violating them. That is why we have a Constitution to empower our government to do those things we need done for the general good such as defense and providing a sound money while limiting it from trampling upon the things that make us a free people, namely our freedom of action, our privacy and our inviolability as individuals.
</p>
<p>In recent years this has been turned on its head as rights we plainly have, rights which are explicitly enumerated such as the right to keep and bear arms are endlessly debated and infringed upon while rights imagined are held up as constitutional.
</p>
<p>A case in point: What ever happened to the Fourth Amendment?
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#8221;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where our God given right to privacy is acknowledged and protected by the Constitutional government of the United States. It expressly mentions the inviolability of our &#8220;houses, papers, and effects.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mention abortion. This is the pattern in America today: ignore what the Constitution plainly says and extol imagined things the Progressives wish it said.
</p>
<p>Today a Progressive Supreme Court has decreed there is a constitutional right to privacy involved when a woman wants to terminate the life of an unborn child and nowhere else in our 21st century surveillance state America? The right to terminate life is protected and even subsidized by the central government and the right to have a private conversation is no longer acknowledged. Today in the post-constitutional America it is all right for the government to listen to and record every communication of every citizen and the one person who tells us that they are doing so is a traitor.
</p>
<p>All it takes is the right set of lenses and we can see clearly. Rather than not making any sense it all makes total sense. Our leaders are leading us from where we have been: a constitutionally limited government ensuring personal freedom, individual liberty and economic opportunity to a centrally-planned, highly regimented, constantly watched society marching lock-step towards a utopia that will never work. With leaders like this all I can do is echo Scott Adams warning, &#8220;Don&#8217;t step in the leadership.&#8221;</p>

<p>Secretary of State John Kerry says the use of chemical weapons in Syria is &#8220;<em>a moral obscenity</em>&#8220;.<br/><br/>With that clue (and many others), note that <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0702d1d4-0e6c-11e3-81ab-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl" target="_blank"><strong>Obama prepares wary US public for war with Syria</strong></a>. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>The White House has begun to prepare a wary US public for military action in Syria, with a flurry of well-publicized meetings of the administration&#8217;s national security team, backed by a statement by secretary of state, John Kerry, calling the regime&#8217;s use of chemical weapons &#8220;a moral obscenity.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mr Kerry said on Monday President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s forces&#8217; responsibility for the use of chemical weapons in an attack which left hundreds dead last week was &#8220;undeniable&#8221;, cementing a sharp about-turn in Washington&#8217;s response to the issue. <br/><br/>Mr Obama said last year the use of chemical weapons would cross a &#8220;red line&#8221; in a conflict which the US has stayed out of, apart from promising to funnel weapons to some anti-Assad forces. <em>Subsequently, however, when faced with allegations that chemical weapons had been used, administration officials had suggested they could not be conclusively traced back to Mr Assad&#8217;s military.</em><br/><br/>The US is now moving quickly, and together with its Nato allies, could launch air strikes as early as Thursday or Friday this week, said individuals familiar with internal administration deliberations.

</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syria&#8217;s civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syria&#8217;s government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed, a Reuters/Ipsos poll says.<br/><br/>About 60 percent of Americans surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria&#8217;s civil war, while just 9 percent thought President Barack Obama should act.<br/><br/>The Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken August 19-23, found that 25 percent of Americans would support U.S. intervention if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s forces used chemicals to attack civilians, while 46 percent would oppose it. That represented a decline in backing for U.S. action since August 13, when Reuters/Ipsos tracking polls found that 30.2 percent of Americans supported intervention in Syria if chemicals had been used, while 41.6 percent did not.<br/><br/>Taken together, the polls suggest that so far, the growing crisis in Syria, and the emotionally wrenching pictures from an alleged chemical attack in a Damascus suburb this week, may actually be hardening many Americans&#8217; resolve not to get involved in another conflict in the Middle East.

<p>When reading the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, one has to wonder what about that amendment is so difficult to understand.  It is simple, concise and contains no hidden meaning.  The Second Amendment reads, &#8220;<strong>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>But, if you are the federal government and can&#8217;t get through the front or back door, the next best thing is to go through the window.  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/house-bill-would-boost-tax-on-ammo-by-50-guns-20">Rep. Danny K. Davis (D – IL) and Rep. Bill Pascrell (D – NJ) have sponsored a new gun control scheme</a> that would increase the federal excise tax on ammunition to 50 percent and the tax on some firearms to 20 percent.  <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3018/text">H.R. 3018</a> or the <a href="http://www.davis.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=362:reps-davis-and-pascrell-introduce-gun-violence-prevention-and-safe-communities-act&amp;catid=28:latest&amp;Itemid=55">&#8220;Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act of 2013&#8243;</a> has been called &#8220;confiscatory taxation&#8221; by Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Chairman Alan Gottlieb.
</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/house-bill-would-boost-tax-on-ammo-by-50-guns-20">Examiner.com</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;What they couldn&#8217;t ban,&#8221; Gottlieb said, &#8220;they are now trying to tax out of existence.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>He suggested the measure might even constitute a raid on the federal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittman–Robertson_Federal_Aid_in_Wildlife_Restoration_Act">Pittman-Robertson Act</a>, otherwise known as the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act that has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to state wildlife and natural resources agencies since it became law in 1937. The funds are apportioned back to the states by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service for wildlife restoration, habitat improvement and enhancement, range development and hunter education.</em>
	</p>
<p><em>Under the bill, the federal excise tax would be raised to 20 percent on pistols, revolvers and other firearms, and any &#8220;lower frame or receiver for a firearm, whether for a semiautomatic pistol, rifle or shotgun that is designed to accommodate interchangeable upper receivers.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Clearly this is aimed at AR-15 type rifles and every handgun on the landscape, and ammunition that is used by sport shooters, hunters and armed citizens for personal protection. Particularly hard hit would be bird hunters, who are already paying premium prices for non-toxic shotgun shells.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;A 50 percent increase in the cost of ammunition that is already skyrocketing in price taxes people out of the market,&#8221; Gottlieb said today.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the old saying goes, &#8220;where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way.&#8221;  When these anti-patriots read the Second Amendment, they probably thought, &#8220;hey, this thing says nothing about ammunition.&#8221;  It takes a real conniving leftist intent on disarming Americans to infer the founding fathers did not include ammunition in that amendment.  Let&#8217;s be honest here, common sense would dictate any type of firearm is worthless without the ammunition.  Time and time again, it has been revealed our founding fathers practiced sound logic and common sense; therefore, they would definitely argue that ammunition is inferred in the simple eloquence of the Second Amendment.
</p>
<p>Regardless, gun grabbers continue to pursue any avenue they can find to take away the God-given right of the people to defend themselves.  By using taxation on ammunition as a punitive measure, the left is essentially trying to price ammunition out of affordability.  There would be no need to grab guns if no one could afford the ammunition.  This would also mean that any gun owner would not be able to replenish their supply once it is exhausted, due to the expense.  The gun grabbing fanatics could rest against attacking the Second Amendment, leaving it intact; but, the increasing price of ammunition along with its unreasonable taxation would mean empty firearms.
</p>
<p>The Examiner.com article points out that the city of Chicago implemented a new program aimed at making streets safer for school children.  According to the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/22158887-418/safe-passage-routes-put-to-test-amid-more-shootings.html">Chicago-Sun Times</a>, a 28 year old man was shot along one of the &#8220;Safe Passage&#8221; routes and a 14 year old boy was &#8220;shot to death near another one, the day before school starts.&#8221;  The Safe Passage program employed 600 workers but failed to prevent these tragedies.
</p>
<p>Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, Washington CeaseFire and advocates of so-called &#8220;gun free zone&#8221; businesses have introduced a program to &#8220;have Seattle businesses discriminate against legally-armed citizens, since they have been unable to get the Legislature or the courts to agree to their visions of Utopia.&#8221;  A former policeman turned attorney dubbed the businesses as &#8220;zones of happy thoughts&#8221; because McGinn himself admitted that gun free zone decals would not prevent a violent crime.
</p>
<p>Duh!  Mayor McGinn needs a large crowbar to pull his head out.  Gun free zone decals are almost an advertisement to anyone intent on committing a crime to go into a gun free zone.  Since businesses are encouraged to discriminate against legally-armed citizens, how exactly are the businesses to determine who is legally-armed before providing a service?  If legally-armed citizens are to be discriminated against, does it mean that illegally-armed individuals are okay to receive one of these businesses&#8217; service or are they excluded as well?
</p>
<p>Criminals do not obey laws – that&#8217;s why they are criminals.  The brain dead left can&#8217;t seem to come to terms with this fact.  The left naively believes eliminating the Second Amendment will curtail crime.  Wrong, again.  A criminal will use anything as a weapon if needs be, when their intent is violent.  The best deterrent to crime is legally-armed citizens.  One only has to look to Chicago to see the effects of gun control; but, McGinn is not interested in examining Chicago&#8217;s issues or learning from that city&#8217;s mistakes.
</p>
<p>The left cannot see the Second Amendment as a protection against oppression and tyranny by an over-reaching, out of control federal government or a deterrent to crime and inhibitor of chaos.  This amendment is seen as an atrocity and those who support it as carriers of leprosy or the Black Death.  Since us leprosy carriers understand the amendment&#8217;s intent and refuse to remain silent on any type of gun control, the left concocts a new avenue – an unreasonable, punitive tax on ammunition.
</p>
<p>Patriotic Americans know this is actually not about crime at all.  This is about disarming a free society in order to subjugate it.  And from the looks of it, the federal government is getting plenty of help from some state governments and local municipalities.</p>

<p>Sometimes I stumble upon a story that I can&#8217;t pass up. This is one of those times. It would be morally wrong to have a couple of slices of bacon with your eggs but by all means you can not disturb or try to eradicate the blessed lice living in Muslim beards, for they are special lice that were sent forth by Allah. I am not making this up.

<p><em>The Sharia Authority in Aleppo has prohibited the killing of lice that appears in the Muslim beard, as some of the Muslim brothers who have released [grown] their beards in accordance with prophet Muhammad PBuH Sunnah [prophet's doctrine], blessed lice has appeared in their beards, and that&#8217;s because of their lack of bathing due to the water non-availability all the time on the Jihad [holy war] fronts, and they have limited to ablution before their prayers (may God accept it), thus their beards became moist and thick, which made of it (in God&#8217;s will) a natural place for lice to live in.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The Sharia Authority in Aleppo recommends the Mujahideen [holy fighters] brothers to dye their beards with Henna, like our prophet Muhammad PBuH, the thing that would reduce the itching caused by the lice, and to maintain this lice that would have not appeared in those blessed beards, if it was not from God&#8217;s Muslim believing creatures.<br />

<p>I wonder what Allah says about crabs? Would they be blessed crabs? If your woman dares question your blessed crabs are you required to discipline her?
</p>
<p>This is Islam. Of course you would be required to discipline her. You might even <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/islamic-cleric-muhammad-sharif-hacks-wife-into-pieces-for-refusing-to-wear-a-veil/" title="Islamic Cleric Hacks Wife into Pieces for Refusing to Wear a Veil" target="_blank">chop her into many pieces</a> for questioning your blessed crabs that were sent by Allah.
</p>
<p>This is just stupid.

<p>If I ever found myself in a situation where I had lice in my beard, you had better believe I&#8217;d be shaving it or doing whatever I had to do to get rid of them.

<p>What if Christian lice infiltrate the beard and try to forcibly convert the believer lice?
</p>
<p>If a Muslim man is found with Christian lice living in his beard then I say… <em>off with his head. </em>Or, at the very least cleanse him by <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/07/muslims-laugh-as-they-pour-acid-over-mother-walking-6-year-old-twins-home-from-school/" title="Laughing Muslim Gang Pour Acid Over Mother As She Walked Her 6-Year-Old Twins Home From School (Geller, Atlas Shrugs)" target="_blank">throwing acid in his face.</a>

<p>I&#8217;m getting a little itchy just thinking about this. I&#8217;m done. There is no story here. I just thought that if it entertained me it might entertain someone else.

<p>Leave it to Obama to support a group of ragheads who believe that head lice are pets.</p>

<p>The defense department has recently <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/08/defense-department-documents-extremists-speak-individual-liberties-states-rights-make-world-better-place/">released some new publications</a> that aim to teach young service members that people discussing individual liberties and states&#8217; rights are extremists. It even goes so far to describe the founders of our beloved nation as being &#8220;extreme&#8221; in the fact that they rebelled against British rule. This isn&#8217;t the first time that our government has labeled liberty minded patriots as being radical. In 2009, The Department of Homeland Security issued a report entitled &#8220;Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence and Recruitment,&#8221; which can be <a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rightwing.pdf">viewed here</a>.  This report claims that anyone who believes in the constitution or the Bible is a potential terrorist. It also claims that veterans pose a threat to homeland security and that gun owners are right wing radicals. Never mind that the perpetrators of all the recent mass shootings have been left wingers, law abiding gun owners are the real threat. Interestingly, as we witness the push to use mental health laws as a means of restricting our second amendment rights there is another peculiar report you should be made aware of. Called &#8220;Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition&#8221; which can be <a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PoliticalConservatism2003.pdf">seen here</a>, the author tries to convince his readers that political conservatives are mentally ill because of our resistance to change and the way we justify racism in our society.  When you also consider the fact that the U.S. military has once again been asked if they would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse to surrender firearms, (the first time being in 1995 at Marine base 29 Palms) a very dark image emerges indeed.
</p>
<p>This is social engineering with the explicit purpose of turning one group of Americans against another. Just as it is with white privilege education, young service members, having already endured an education that is severely biased to a &#8220;real&#8221; radical leftist world view, one where they insist on teaching the same failures that led to 170,000,000 people killed by their own governments is being pushed by men with an agenda. It&#8217;s not hard to see where this is going nor is it difficult to see the agenda for what it is; the destruction of our constitutional republic and the surrendering of our sovereignty to a global system of governance administered by the United Nations.
</p>
<p>What makes it all the worse is the fact that this agenda seems to be going full speed ahead virtually unchallenged. While there are a few conservatives who have demonstrated they have the necessary courage to call it what it is, most so called republicans can be counted on to simply &#8220;cave in&#8221; out of fear of being singled out by the mainstream media. Personally, I think a conscious effort needs to be made, by every single one of us, to reach out to our soldiers and either educate them or encourage them to throw their boots over the wire and tell the once honorable Uncle Sam to kiss off.
</p>
<p><strong>In Federalist No. 8 Alexander Hamilton writes on the dangers that standing armies grow to pose on their fellow countrymen. He says that the continual necessity for the services of military enhances their importance while diminishing the status of the citizenry. He goes on to say that the military state comes to be elevated above the rest of the people.</strong> How wise they were because that seems to be the situation we are in now as our service members are being taught to hate their own brethren. This is why the United States Constitution was written to provide for the maintenance of a Navy and the appropriations of funds for a standing Army for no more than two years.
</p>
<p>Article 1, Section 8, Clause 13:
</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;The congress shall have the power to provide and maintain a Navy&#8221;</em></strong>
	</p>
<p>Article 1, Section 8, Clause 12 states that:

<p><strong><em>&#8220;The congress shall have the power to raise and support armies, but no appropriations of money to that use shall be for more than two years.&#8221;</em></strong>
	</p>
<p>In other words, according to the U.S. Constitution a standing army was to be avoided for the very reasons we are witnessing today, and the second amendment was written to provide people with the means of defending the nation. Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 states:
</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;The congress shall have the power to….provide for the calling forth of the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrection and repel invasion.&#8221;</em></strong>
	</p>
<p>According to Richard Henry Lee, the &#8220;militia,&#8221; when properly formed is made up of the people themselves and includes all men who are able to bear arms.  Put in the context of the U.S. constitution this makes sense because the idea of our republic is that the people are sovereign to government power and the government is a servant to the people. This could not be the case except for the first ten amendments to the U.S. constitution which are known as the bill of rights. Today it seems as if many people accept the idea that the federal government, through the supremacy clause has total power over the states. This is untrue.  They only have supreme power over those laws that support the constitution, and the tenth amendment explicitly states:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong><em>All powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people, respectively.&#8221;  </em></strong>
	</p>
<p>Throughout the twentieth century armies of men loyal to their governments and their nations were used to exterminate over 170,000,000 people who opposed the direction their nations were going. This is more dead people in a one hundred year period than in all of history&#8217;s wars combined. The founding fathers understood the realities of this evil, and this is why we have a constitution that consciously separates the powers of the federal government while purposely creating a system where they are accountable to us, &#8220;WE THE PEOPLE.&#8221; For all practical purposes, many of you seem to be willing to surrender that power while ignoring the danger that doing so poses. If standing up for freedom makes me an extremist then so be it, I am an extremist. If talking about the constitution and our founding fathers makes me a terrorist then I guess I am a terrorist because I am not going to stop. I am not going to cower in fear, in a nation founded on the very idea of people living free from government oppression while my heart still beats, nor should you. The only way we can win this nation back is if we give it everything we have and drop the fear of consequence for not being &#8220;politically correct.&#8221;
</p>
<p>(Authors note) I am not suggesting that the U.S. Army should be dismantled or shouldn&#8217;t exist. I am only referencing the wisdom of the founders in their attempts to prevent tyranny.</p>

<p>America needs to talk now. It can&#8217;t wait until tomorrow. It can&#8217;t wait until our lousy elected servants decide to debate the subject. There are warships headed toward Syria now and Russia is preparing to counter. This could lead to World War III and I don&#8217;t know how else to put it… <strong>YOU AND YOUR FAMILY COULD DIE FOR THESE IDIOTS</strong>. This could cost millions of lives because if Russia and China get involved, which could very well happen, this war will not be pretty. We are talking about a real possibility of nuclear weapons being used and American civilians dying.

There is evidence to suggest that Barack Obama would not be the first president to put us into a war under false pretenses and it is not an accusation that can be placed solely on Democrats. So let go of that and let&#8217;s come together as a country right now to talk about what is potentially about to happen, unless we get loud enough to stop it.
</p>

</p>
<p>I want to walk you through some growing evidence and then I will leave it up to you. This is your country. If you care about this country then you will get loud and do it quickly. There is no time to waste. Share the articles and videos. Get in touch with your elected reps. Go to TV stations. Hand out flyers. Do whatever you have to do to stop this war from happening. Act as if your life depends on it. Because it very well might.
</p>
<p><strong>Washington D.C. and our mainstream media have presented ZERO proof that Assad was behind these attacks.</strong> The information I am about to show you will not provide 100% proof that Syrian Rebels are responsible for launching these attacks, but please consider this… <span style="text-decoration:underline">It is more proof then we are getting from the other side.</span>

<p>Two days ago a startling confession came from a former member of Al-Nusra. They have chemical weapons and are intent on using them. This is the side which we are supporting.  <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/08/25/former-jabhat-al-nusrah-member-admits-chemical-weapons-use/" target="_blank">NSNBC International</a> reports:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Abdola Al-Jaledi, a former high-ranking member of the Jabhat al-Nusrah front has revealed on his Twitter account @abo_almonthir, that his Jabhat al-Nusrah colleagues are in possession of chemical weapons, reports the independent Syrian <a href="http://www.dampress.net/" target="_blank">Dampress</a> Online Journal. </strong><br />

</blockquote>
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn the clock back to January when a story broke that suggested the U.S. was planning a chemical weapons attack in Syria to frame Assad. Here is a quote from the original story as printed by <a href="http://www.infowars.com/hack-reveals-washington-approved-plan-to-stage-chemical-weapons-attack-in-syria/" target="_blank">InfoWars</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Alleged hacked emails from defense contractor Britam reveal a plan &#8220;approved by Washington&#8221; and funded by Qatar to stage a chemical weapons attack in Syria and blame it on the Assad regime, fulfilling what the Obama administration has made clear is a &#8220;red line&#8221; that would mandate US military intervention.<br />
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082713_1356_GrowingEvid3.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082713_1356_GrowingEvid3-150x150.jpg" alt="082713_1356_GrowingEvid3.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10973" /></a><em>The leaked emails, obtained by a hacker in Germany, feature an exchange (<a href="http://static.prisonplanet.com/p/images/january2013/280113email.png">click here</a> for screenshot) between Britam Defence&#8217;s Business Development Director David Goulding and the company&#8217;s founder Philip Doughty;<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Phil<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>We&#8217;ve got a new offer. It&#8217;s about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>We&#8217;ll have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have. They want us to deploy our Ukrainian personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Frankly, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea but the sums proposed are enormous. Your opinion?<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Kind regards<br/>David<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The fact that the plan involves delivering a CW (chemical weapon) that is &#8220;similar to those Assad should have,&#8221; clearly suggests that the idea is to stage a false flag chemical weapons attack that could be blamed on Assad by Gulf states like Qatar and NATO powers.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>If the claim that such as plot was &#8220;approved by Washington&#8221; can be verified, then the Obama administration is complicit in a war crime.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Say what you want about Alex Jones but he was on this story 7 months ago while you were eating cheetos and watching prime time TV. If you must discount this source then go ahead. There is plenty of other evidence that is mounting.
</p>
<p>Thank God for Jerome Corsi of WND.com. He is probably my favorite journalist because he has zero fear. He only wants the truth to come out. Corsi delivered on Monday Night with his own scathing collection of evidence that the Syrian Rebels are responsible for these attacks.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/video-shows-rebels-launching-gas-attack-in-syria/" target="_blank">Corsi</a> reports:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Assad has rejected charges that his government forces used chemical weapons as &#8220;preposterous&#8221; and &#8220;completely politicized,&#8221; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-syria-assad-denies-use-of-chemical-weapons-20130826,0,1287208.story">the Los Angeles Times reported</a>.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>He argues Syrian forces were in the targeted area.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;How is it possible that any country would use chemical weapons, or any weapons of mass destruction, in an area where its own forces are located?&#8221; Assad asked in the interview with Izvestia, according to a translation provided by Syria&#8217;s official news agency and published by the Los Angeles Times.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is preposterous! These accusations are completely politicized and come on the back of the advances made by the Syrian Army against the <a href="http://dcclothesline.com/2013/03/15/terrorists/" title="terrorists">terrorists</a>.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rebel attack?</strong><br />
		</em></p>
<p><em>With the assistance of former PLO member and native Arabic-speaker Walid Shoebat, WND has assembled evidence from various Middle Eastern sources that cast doubt on Obama administration claims the Assad government is responsible for last week&#8217;s attack.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>A video posted on YouTube, embedded below, shows Free Syrian Army, or FSA, rebel forces launching a Sarin gas attack on a Syrian village.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above link will open in a new window, so you can read the article and return if you wish. Corsi has multiple videos and some really good information that casts serious doubts on the Obama Administration&#8217;s claim that this attack came from Assad.
</p>
<p>Finally I would like to present a video that is the best I have seen thus far. It puts together a lot of what we know and also provides valuable links to resources that will back up the idea that this was nothing more than a set up with heavy U.S. involvement.

<p>Look my friends, this is one of the most unpolished pieces of writing you will ever see but it has to get out. I don&#8217;t have time to find perfect words. Lately it has been tough to find time to shower (we have newborn twins). I didn&#8217;t have time to dig up every single piece of evidence available. I wanted to put enough in front of people to shed some doubt.
</p>
<p>My belief is that Obama is putting 300+ million Americans in harm&#8217;s way and I had to do something to try to get the word out. Let&#8217;s give up this stupid liberal/conservative crap for a moment and call this what it is.
</p>
<p>We may soon be fighting for our very survival.
</p>
<p>We cannot allow this to happen to America. Somehow we have to stop it this time.
</p>
<p>These people work for us and 92% of Americans do not want us involved in Syria with either side, from what I have heard. I don&#8217;t have the source for that statistic but I don&#8217;t need one to know that most people are against this. I have yet to meet a person that is for it. <strong>Finally we have something that democrats and republicans will agree on…WE HAVE NO BUSINESS IN SYRIA, PERIOD!!!</strong>
	</p>
<p>Now get out there and raise some hell. We have to stop asking these leaders to listen to us. We must demand it.
</p>
<p>I know a lot of people feel tired and defeated now. I feel that way myself a lot. But tired and defeated is better than dead any day.
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to wake people up but I have to keep trying and you do too. When we are putting our hopes in Vladimir Putin to keep his composure then we all know that something is very wrong in America.
</p>
<p>It has to stop and it has to stop now. </p>

<h5>The black mob Minneapolis violence has gotten out of control. It&#8217;s not an adult mob doing the taunting and abusing. This time, children are the props, the ones doing the abusing. They are the new black mob in training. And what viewers will see in this video is shocking. <iframe src="http://www.liveleak.com/ll_embed?f=c01b4616cc68" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></h5>
<p>Is anyone believing what they are seeing? This is the black mob in action. And this is surely the most traumatizing video because it involves children. Black children <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">taunting </a>a three year old white girl. They&#8217;re the militia in training, the ones waiting in the wings to start the cycle of violence that is taking over every major city in this country. But no one is talking about it. To speak of the black mob is to speak of racism.</p>
<p>Chicago is ablaze with black mob violence. A <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-on-rampage-fractures-cops-skull/">police officer</a> had his skull bashed in with a baseball bat on Saturday by a black mob in Chicago. Right now, he&#8217;s lying in a hospital bed. Will he survive? Hopefully. Will he regain normalcy? It is too early to tell.</p>
<p>But the black mob Minneapolis tale is more sinister. Children in training, following the lead of adults. In this video, four black children surround a white girl and taunt and slap her. If she had been seriously hurt by one of the children, no one would come to her rescue. And she could easily have been severely hurt.</p>
<p>This is the new America. This video was posted on Facebook this weekend under the <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">title</a>, “When white people piss black people off.”</p>
<p>No the title is not a misprint. It&#8217;s the real deal. This title in reference to a three year old toddler on a tricycle.</p>
<p>There is no question this is youth indoctrination. In many ways this akin to Hitler youth indoctrination. Teach young Aryans to hate Jews. In this case, teach black toddlers and pre-teens to hate little white children who are barely old enough to go to preschool.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Domestic-violence-Children.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10970" alt="Domestic-violence-Children" src="http://cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Domestic-violence-Children-300x139.jpg" width="300" height="139" /></a>The black girls, who are twice as big as the white child, say to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">her</a>, “Stop spying on us,” shouts one. “You ugly.” And then the two girls proceed to grab her <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">wrists</a> to slap herself in the face with her own hands. As if this isn&#8217;t cruel enough. And naturally she cries because it hurts and she&#8217;s only three years old. She&#8217;s surrounded by older girls and they are twice her size.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Older boys enter the picture, clearly knowing they are being filmed. The boy filming yells, &#8220;Stop hitting yourself.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t stop the girls from taunting her. Then a ten year old boy says he&#8217;s going to beat the little girl up. He doesn&#8217;t, but instead asks to see the video.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">After </a>a cut in the action, the video picks up with the little white girl now standing on the lawn. The two black girls approach, with one instructing the other: “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">Hit </a>her hard. Hit her in the head like this.” And the do just that.</p></blockquote>
<p>After more taunting from the black girls, the video ended. But once it hit Facebook, the boy who filmed it, identified as 12 year old <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">Ray Wright</a>, wrote, &#8220;I (am going) to jail,” he wrote on his now deleted Facebook account, captured at <a href="http://patdollard.com/">PatDollard.com.</a> “Somebody snitched. I’m (going) to kill them.”</p>
<p>These are children. And none of their identities are known, except for the boy filming or any other real information about them. Where exactly are they? They are in Minneapolis, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>However, another more sinister picture is presents itself when it is learned that the mother of the young man who filmed the incident, had a picture of himself on Facebook with a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">loaded</a> gun. Ray Wright is a 12-year old child. His mother, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">Ranika Wills</a>, denied her son&#8217;s involvement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">It’s</a> a joke, he’s just a kid,” said the mother.</p></blockquote>
<p>Except it isn&#8217;t a joke. This is real. Children as young as three years old are involved in black mob violence now. How young is too young and when will this senseless violence end? Our culture is dying for hate and for nothing. And white people can&#8217;t speak up because it&#8217;s racist. Our leaders say it&#8217;s so. This is indoctrination at it&#8217;s worst and most deadly. This is American white privilege in action. Hate breeds hate. And decades of dancing around the death trap of political correctness have brought us to where we are today. This is a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">video</a> of a taped <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/black-mob-in-training-bullies-3-year-old/">conversation </a>with Ray Wright&#8217;s mother. Watch it and weep for the souls of young people.<br />

<p>I am a high school English teacher. I became a teacher because I believe that literacy, which goes beyond just reading the words on the page, is an absolute necessity for maintaining our Republic. Proof of that is found in the many laws against reading certain texts, or against reading altogether, that have been passed down by every tyrant since literacy became available to the general population. A few examples of such tyrannical laws are the Taliban banning reading for any female or laws against teaching slaves to read or the Soviet Union&#8217;s banning of such books as A Wrinkle in Time, Where&#8217;s Waldo, and To Kill a Mockingbird. The communist Khmer Rogue in Cambodia so hated literacy that just wearing glasses was cause for execution. Literacy leads to freedom and tyrants know it.
</p>
<p>I have been teaching for over twenty years. Generally, I have been given either no curriculum or curriculum that was focused on skills, not specific texts. I would have to get those skills taught in whatever way I wanted to get there. Sometimes I was given more direction and that direction was generally pretty good including texts, key terms, supplemental stories, and suggested writing assignments. These directions were created at a school level by the teachers in the school. I helped write some myself. Mostly, I have had a lot of freedom in how I could achieve the learning goals.
</p>
<p>Not anymore.
</p>
<p>Today I was in a professional development session for my school district. Our school system has swallowed the Common Core curriculum whole. Why wouldn&#8217;t they? The federal system has said that it is &#8220;voluntary&#8221;, but &#8220;voluntary&#8221; means that the district gets cut off from major federal funding if it does not adopt the standards, so &#8220;voluntary&#8221; is subjective. Here is what the Washington Post reported Sen. Charles Grassley has to say about Common Core:
</p>
<p>Current federal law makes clear that the U.S. Department of Education may not be involved in setting specific content standards or determining the content of state assessments. Nevertheless, the selection criteria designed by the U.S. Department of Education for the Race to the Top Program provided that for a state to have any chance to compete for funding, it must commit to adopting a &#8220;common set of K-12 standards&#8221; matching the description of the Common Core.
</p>
<p>The Washington Post also reported, </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Republican National Committee recognizes the CCSS for what it is — an inappropriate overreach to standardize and control the education of our children…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Common Core, it is a curriculum created in the private sector but pushed onto states by the federal government and endorsed by Bill Gates. The cost of implementing the program runs from millions to billions depending on the state. It is untested and unresearched. It has been criticized for being not as rigorous as proponents claim, clearly biased to a liberal perspective, so much so that many see it as indoctrination, and it is being forced on the states in spite of the fact that a federal curriculum is unconstitutional violating the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which established the principle that&#8221;…the &#8220;power&#8221; to oversee education belongs to the states. This longstanding principle of local control of education is reiterated throughout our laws and government codes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All of that sounds like something that makes NO connection whatsoever to most parents or teachers or American citizens as to why they should fight this curriculum. Here, I am going to provide you with a concrete example that shows the ugly heart of the Common Core. There is something deeply dark and offensive in this lesson created to support Common Core. It is a lesson designed to corrupt essential human decency.
</p>
<p>The unit – sorry &#8220;module&#8221; – that I am using as an example is centered around To Kill a Mockingbird with the theme of &#8220;How individuals demonstrate individuality in the face of outside pressures.&#8221; At the beginning of all of this, it looks good. I love the book; it is a great American classic and I have taught it many times. The module includes 30 days of lessons associated with the novel and multiple additional short reading assignments. However, as I looked this module over, I became more and more concerned. For me to break down the many problems with this module in detail would take quite a while, so I am going to show you an example of one lesson on one short reading assignment that left me speechless with horror.
</p>
<p>This assignment in the module includes a short story by <a href="http://www.classicreader.com/author/105/">Guy de Maupassant</a>, 19th century writer famous for The Necklace. Again, this seems rather innocent; this story is often included in high school texts, but not this particular story and, more importantly, not with this particular writing assignment.
</p>
<p>The short story is <a href="http://www.classicreader.com/book/1238/1/" target="_blank">The Mother of Monsters</a> (<a href="http://www.classicreader.com/book/1238/1/" target="_blank">link</a>). A quick summary of the story is that a gentleman on vacation is introduced to the Mother of Monsters, a local oddity described as a &#8220;peasant&#8221; and the &#8220;Devil&#8221;. Her story is that she finds herself pregnant while she is working as a simple serving girl. She binds her body with boards and cords to hide her growing belly. Her child is born horribly deformed. She takes care of the child, but resents it, until a sideshow man comes along and offers to buy the &#8220;thing&#8221; and to pay a yearly stipend for its use. Once she realizes how much money she can make, she repeats her pregnancy pattern by birthing monster after monster after monster of intentionally deformed children to sell to showmen. She lives a &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; life as a result (note the stab at the bourgeois here).
</p>
<p>The narrator is reminded of this &#8220;Devil&#8221; when he later sees a popular &#8220;Parissiane&#8221; strolling on a beach followed by admirers. Her three children are also all deformed because she wants to maintain her trim figure throughout her pregnancies, so she keeps her corset tightly cinched. Peasant and lady; different, yet the same. Both the Mother of Monsters. Both display a level of selfish evil that most humans would revile.
</p>
<p>Now as a high school story, this story may have a lot of meat to chew on for discussion…for maybe 11th or 12thgraders, but this is a story assigned to incoming 9th graders, students who are 13 or 14 years old. Students this age are not ready to handle the truly disturbing elements of a story which reveals some of the most perverse sides of human nature. That is bad enough; however, it gets worse. You may wonder what this story has to do with To Kill a Mockingbird and the theme of individuality. Here is the writing assignment associated with this story:
</p>
<p>Write an essay that compares the cultural experience reflected in To Kill a Mockingbird and The Mother of Monsters and explain how this experience helped a character demonstrate individuality in the face of outside pressure.
</p>
<p>Individuality! Outside Pressure! These women chose to deform their children for their own selfish gains or selfish vanity! The first pregnancy of the peasant woman we might forgive out of mercy, but the purposeful birthing of the rest of the 11 children that she intentionally deformed is unconscionable and unforgivable. The same holds with the Parisienne.
</p>
<p>To judge these women as demonstrating their INDIVIDUALITY in the face of outside pressure is absurd and defies human decency. It is like insisting Jeffery Dahmer was expressing his individuality through cannibalistic murder. Additionally, it is not a major leap to conclude that if deforming your children in order to express your own individuality is acceptable, then killing your children to protect your individuality (or selfish inhumanity) is perfectly fine too. This is obviously a pro-abortion message. This story paired with this assignment is a repulsive perversion of the concept of &#8220;lesson&#8221;; it is a corruption of anything descent and good.
</p>
<p>There is something deeply repulsive in this lesson, especially as it is aimed at students as young as 13. I have been told that I must teach this module. I can make some adjustments, but not too many. I am struggling to find a way to NOT perpetuate the ugliness found here. I am certainly NOT going to teach this story, though I may find myself in trouble with the system as a result. Some things are worth refusing to do even if there is a cost.
</p>
<p>This is what is going on in our schools. This is what you need to see with open eyes. They are doing more than trying to increase rigor; they are indoctrinating our children into one way of thinking—their way! Schools should teach how to think, but never what to think. This is why we must fight what some are trying to sell us as &#8220;hope and change&#8221; to America.</p>

<h4>Did Syria really use chemical weapons or is it simply being made to look that way?</h4>
<p>I read an <a href="http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/57454">article</a> today by Doug Hagmann of Canada Free Press. In it, he shares with us information he says he received from one of his &#8220;insiders.&#8221; The information specifically notes that the recent chemical attacks in Syria were most likely not done by Assad&#8217;s forces even though that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re told to believe. According to the insider, it&#8217;s all part of a magic show to delude people and the media plays willingly along.</p>
<p>There are some facts related to the Syrian situation that make a strong case for the fact that the chemical attack was not done by Assad&#8217;s forces. &#8220;The anti-Assad ‘rebels’ are losing, they’re in retreat, because the exposure to the arms and weapons running from Benghazi caused the architects of this conflict to lay low for a while. That gave us some time, but it did not change their objective of overthrowing Assad and taking Syria for the Muslim Brotherhood. The anti-Assad rebels cannot survive without Western assistance. Considering that, what sense would it make for Assad to use chemical weapons, especially as international observers were getting in position to investigate the situation, against rebels in retreat?&#8221;</p>
<p>If anti-Assad rebels are losing, Assad has no reason to use chemical weapons. He can simply keep the pressure up and wait it out. Plus, Russia has his back and China has an interest in the region as well. It&#8217;s not as if Syria is left to fend for themselves. What this ultimately means is that if the U.S. gets into this war, we will be fighting against Russia.</p>
<p>Does anyone seem to care that Barack Obama seems to have gotten us involved in at least as many wars/conflicts as George W. Bush did. What a surprise. Another politician who makes promises he does not keep. Somehow, that&#8217;s Bush&#8217;s fault, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>I was also reading a book by Dr. John Coleman this morning called &#8220;The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.&#8221; Coleman has spent most of life researching, connecting the dots, and the &#8220;study of 37,000 pages of the Annals of Congress, the Congressional Globe, and Congressional Record.&#8221; Critics simply call him a &#8220;conspiracy theorist.&#8221;</p>
<p>At any rate, one of his chapters deals with the 1991 Gulf War and the propaganda that was employed to dupe Americans into thinking that we needed to invade Iraq. It&#8217;s interesting how the scenario is very similar to present day Syria.</p>
<p>We originally heard that Saddam was using chemical weapons against the Kurds from Colin Powell after he returned from Iraq and stated that Hussein had gassed Kurds during the Iraq-Iran War. Coleman states that &#8220;the gas-filled missiles that fell on the Kurdish village were phosgene, a type not possessed by Iraq, but they were in an arsenal in Iran. What happened was that during an Iraqi offensive, the Iranians fired a large number of gas-filled rockets at Iraqi position, but some fell short among the Kurds along the border. This was confirmed by the U.S. Military College of War report, which entirely exonerated Iraq.&#8221; [1] The damage was done. The world believed that Saddam was gassing Kurds. He was definitely a bad guy.</p>
<p>We were also witness to the &#8220;eye witness&#8221; testimony of a young woman who said, in part, &#8220;I saw the Iraqi soldiers pull the new born babies out of the incubators and thrown (sic) them on the ground.&#8221; [2] Who (except abortionists and pro-choice people) would not be moved by such testimony? Unfortunately, it was all bunk. The woman &#8220;turned out to be the teenage daughter of the Al Sabah family&#8217;s Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington&#8221; and the woman had not been in Kuwait during the time she said these atrocities were occurring. She had, in fact, been &#8220;with her father at the ambassador&#8217;s Washington residence.&#8221; [3] It can even be proven that Bush had met the woman several times previously.</p>
<p>These events helped shape public opinion so that it seemed right to invade Iraq and topple Saddam&#8217;s dictatorship. This is exactly what the US did. Any chance it was about oil, not Democracy? Well, since the dollar has been fiat money for quite some time (in exchange for oil, under Nixon), it&#8217;s a real possibility.</p>
<p>Years later, we have the same line of reasoning used by Obama with respect to the Arab Spring. While he says he&#8217;s pushing for Democracy, it appears as though the Middle East, including North Africa is no better off today after having ousted Mubarak, Qadaffi, and others. Certainly, the Muslim Brotherhood is no better than Mubarak and in many ways, worse. There is also lots of oil in them there parts of the world.</p>
<p>Now, we have the Syrian situation, which is going to get really out of hand, very quickly. Kerry has just held a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/26/kerry-evidence-chemical-weapons-strike-in-syria-undeniable/">press conference</a> today in which he states that the chemical attack in Syria is &#8220;undeniable&#8221; and is a &#8220;moral obscenity.&#8221; He further stated, &#8220;What is before us today is real, and it is compelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know, trying hard to keep my sarcasm and incredulity in check, why should we believe what we are told by our government? Here we are how many years later after Bush went into Iraq and we&#8217;re hearing the same talking points and with the same amount of equivocation. Only the names and faces have changed.</p>
<p>I also am amazed at how these same politicians who can be so certain that a chemical attack occurred, are unable to give a solid, sound, straightforward answer when it comes to Benghazi. This is the height of demagoguery, yet it exists because America was taken over by the global elite decades ago.</p>
<p>Doug Hagmann&#8217;s article goes on to say that his insider says we are approaching WW III if the US engages with Syria. Russia will not stand by and just watch. Neither will China who has an interest in that area of the world. In fact, think of the oil and who would control it.</p>
<p>If this becomes a huge, long drawn out war of any large scale, we will watch the economy tank. Hagmann also says that it will result in the full death of the dollar, to be replaced by another currency altogether.</p>
<p>I think it is hugely ironic that Obama &#8211; who promised to end wars &#8211; continued them and while he says he wants Democracy to rise where dictatorships currently do (the same thing Woodrow Wilson said in the early 1900s that got us into WW I), he seems to care far more about Democracy in other nations than in America. Here, he&#8217;s too busy stripping Americans of their rights guaranteed under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it. Our government tells us what we want to hear and they still do whatever they want anyway. Years ago, Willi Munzenberg (connected with Tavistock Institute) stated, &#8220;All news is lies and all propaganda is disguised as news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sooner we realize that, the sooner things will start making sense.</p>

<p>Today we heard that snipers opened fire on UN weapons inspectors who were looking for evidence of chemical weapons. There is a raging debate in the U.S. on whether this chemical attack was launched by Assad or the Syrian rebels. Obama is getting us dangerously close to provoking a reaction by Russia who is a strategic ally of Assad. In general, one bad decision could trigger World War III. So what&#8217;s new America?
</p>
<p>Today I came across some declassified CIA documents thanks to The Daily Mail and I think people need to look at these. Because, not only did the CIA know that Saddam Hussein was going to use chemical weapons in Iran, America seemed to have no problem with it. At this time, in 1984, the Ayatollah Khomeini and Iran were viewed as a much larger threat than Iraq. We would battle Iraq later as history shows.
</p>
<p>I was 15 years old in 1984 and Ronald Reagan was, and still is in many ways, one of my heroes. But we must constantly look for the truth because putting too much faith in any of these political figures is dangerous, no matter which side of the aisle they come from. Is it truly about right and wrong or is it simply about political agendas?
</p>
<p>Is this warship build up and possible missile launch about right and wrong? I don&#8217;t think so. I don&#8217;t think this is about right and wrong any more than Obama&#8217;s support of the Muslim Brotherhood is. This is not about what is best for the Syrian people, it is about which side more fully advances this administration&#8217;s agenda. In this case that side is the side of the al Qaeda linked Syrian Rebels.
</p>
<p>So did America know that Saddam Hussein was going to use chemical weapons against the people of Iran? Read these declassified documents and you tell me.

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2402174/CIA-helped-Saddam-Hussein-carry-chemical-weapons-attack-Iran-1988-Ronald-Reagan.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a> reports:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Iraq used mustard gas and sarin in early 1988 in four major offensives which helped bring about the end of the eight-year conflict.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>During the whole war, up to 20,000 Iranian troops were killed by mustard gas and nerve agents from Iraq and 100,000 were wounded.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>They were able to launch the strikes after being given maps, satellite pictures and other intelligence by the U.S.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The Americans have always said that Iraq did not reveal that they would launch chemical strikes.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>But documents released in the National Archives and interviews with former serviceman show that the U.S. acquiesced in the use of chemical weapons as they tried to help Saddam with the war<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>…<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Retired Air Force Colonel Rick Francona, a military attache who was working in Baghdad in 1988, told Foreign Policy magazine…<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas. They didn&#8217;t have to. We already knew,&#8221; he told Foreign Policy.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Official documents revealed that the U.S. officials were given detailed information about the use of nerve gas by the Iraqis during the conflict. They indicate that the Americans knew more about Saddam&#8217;s use of chemical weapons than previously thought.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The CIA&#8217;s Director of Central Intelligence William J Casey was given detailed intelligence about the efforts of Iraqi chemical weapons plants to produce mustard gas for troops.<br />
</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I ask you America. If chemical weapons were a matter of foreign policy in 1984 under Ronald Reagan, do you really believe that it is any different today? It only matters when your enemy does it, not your allies.
</p>
<p>The truth is that if proof comes out that those attacks were launched by the rebels it will not matter. Obama and the powers that be have already picked sides. They will make whatever excuse they want to further an agenda.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rarely about right and wrong in D.C.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the truth.
</p>
