<p><iframe width="752" height="423" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzBFwFos-o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In it, one of the many &#8220;crews&#8221; serving as muscle for this <em>uber</em>-mafia does what such crews always do: it destroys something owned by someone else in order to teach them (and everyone else) a lesson. That lesson, of course, is to never forget the <em>violence</em> that hangs over everything the mafia does &#8211; and which will be visited upon you in the event you ever step out of line.</p>
<p>In this case, the crew is the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the victim is a helpless Land Rover Defender  &#8211; and of course, its former owner. The Defender is a model Land Rover sells outside the boundaries of the U.S. Customs and Border Control&#8217;s (and EPA&#8217;s and DOT&#8217;s) &#8220;turf.&#8221; It is not a mafia-approved vehicle for sale <em>here</em> because it does not meet mafia-imposed requirements, particularly as regards the profusion of air bags and so on that the mafia <em>insists</em> every one of us must have &#8211; whether we&#8217;d like to have them or not.</p>
<p>Well, just as some people in the neighborhood refuse to pay the Black Hand for &#8220;protection,&#8221; just so there are people who think it&#8217;s no one else&#8217;s business what sort of vehicle they drive &#8211; especially as regards such things as air bags, the presence or absence of which in no way affects the well-being of <em>other</em> people.  They figure: Why should I be compelled to pay for things I feel no need for and do not want?<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/27/need-know/the-black-hand-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23508"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23508" alt="The Black hand picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Black-hand-picture-300x217.png" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>Seems reasonable. Certainly not objectionable in the sense that such an exercise of free choice ought to invite a violent response. If we lived in a free country, it would not invite a violent response. You want air bags? Buy &#8216;em! You <em>don&#8217;t</em> want &#8216;em? Don&#8217;t buy &#8216;em. No one&#8217;s going to <em>force</em> you, either way.</p>
<p>Ah, but we <em>don&#8217;t</em> live in a free country anymore. The black hand is in control.</p>
<p>The Defender is the sort of vehicle once very popular here but now unavailable &#8211; <em>legally</em> &#8211; and thus, virtually <em>nonexistent</em> here. It is a <em>serious</em> SUV. In addition to not having air bags, it does not have carpet &#8211; or anything else that detracts from being among the most off-road-able vehicles ever made. It is ideal for backwoods work and so beloved by people who actually use their SUVs for such work and who &#8211; unsurprisingly &#8211; aren&#8217;t much interested in the mafia-approved, leather-wrapped and air bag-festooned $50,000 absurdities that prowl suburbia but which their owners dare not actually take off-pavement (the lambs&#8217; wool carpet might get soiled).</p>
<p>Land Rover stopped selling the Defender here about 20 years ago &#8211; because it could no longer do so <em>legally</em>.</p>
<p>That is, in compliance with the mafia&#8217;s orders.</p>
<p>Just as Volkswagen had to stop selling old Bugs here after about 1979 &#8211; but continued to build and sell them in Mexico for decades thereafter.</p>
<p>Thus, to get a Defender (or a VW Bug and numerous other such vehicles) prospective buyers have two options:</p>
<p>They could buy a used one built 20-plus years ago, before the mafia&#8217;s ban went into effect. Unfortunately, when it comes to Defenders, there aren&#8217;t many available &#8211; because of mafia-enforced scarcity. The handful of pre-ban Defenders are treasured by their current owners and when they do go up for sale, they sell for a <em>lot</em> of money.</p>
<p>The <em>second</em> option is what aroused the ire of the mafia: Sneak a newer and much less expensive (and thus, &#8220;illegal&#8221;) Defender into the country. People do this with old Bugs, too. It&#8217;s much less expensive to buy a 10 or so year-old Mexican Bug with solid floorpans than it is to buy a pre-ban 30-plus-year-old U.S.-legal example in need of major rust repairs.</p>
<p>This, of course, the mafia will not abide.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re caught with an &#8220;illegal&#8221; gray market car &#8211; <em>forget about it</em>. And close your eyes, too. Because what will happen to the vehicle is exactly what happened to Sonny in that famous scene in the cinematic <em>Godfather</em>.</p>
<p><iframe width="752" height="423" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sJU2cz9ytPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Watch the video &#8211; if you can (I could not stomach the whole thing and turned it off about three quarters of the way through). The &#8220;illegal&#8221; Defender was not merely crushed. It was savaged. The operator of the machine picked it apart like a sociopathic child pulling wings off a fly.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/27/need-know/crushed-defender-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-23502"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23502" alt="crushed Defender 2" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crushed-Defender-2-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>I cannot bear mindless destruction. This instinctive loathing led me, in time, to an intellectual loathing for the mafia and the inevitable realization that this thing called government is in fact the biggest, most dangerous mafia of them all. Don Corleone, after all, only controlled sections of New York. One could always move to Albany. But the government-mafia&#8217;s reach is almost omnipotent &#8211; and it is a much more vengeful and personally malignant entity.</p>
<p>The Don, after all, probably doesn&#8217;t care whether you drive a Volkswagen or a Hyundai &#8211; nor whether it has air bags or not. Your &#8220;safety&#8221; isn&#8217;t his concern; he just wants your money.</p>
<p>But this mafia-government wants it all. Your money &#8211; and your freedom. It will not allow you <em>anything</em>. No even the freedom to drive what you&#8217;d like to drive. There&#8217;s no amount of money.</p>
<p>Just &#8211; do as we tell you.</p>
<p>Or else.</p>
<p><em>Throw it in the Woods?</em></p>

<p>In the roughly ten days since we threw Goo-guhl in the woods &#8211; removed all their ads from this site after they de-listed us and reduced site income from Adsense to almost nothing &#8211; readers have generously made up most of the shortfall. We&#8217;ve just about covered our nut for August. If we can maintain the level of support we&#8217;ve received thus far, we&#8217;ll get there. <em>Without</em> Goo-guhl. In spite of them.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thanks to all of you!</p>
<p>Now, two questions &#8211; or things I&#8217;d like to bring up:</p>
<p>First is whether we accept any ads at all. Personally, I&#8217;d prefer to keep this site free of advertising. I&#8217;d like to have nothing but commentary (and comments) and news. No one trying to sell you anything. If we can maintain an adequate level of reader support, this is absolutely doable. We&#8217;ll see how things go over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>If we did accept ads, I&#8217;d like to know how you feel about &#8211; for instance &#8211; &#8220;sponsored&#8221; articles. Nothing bylined by me or presented as my work. But, the occasional (once a month?) article that is clearly a pitch for some product or service &#8211; and clearly identified as such. You&#8217;d see something like: Sponsored Article &#8211; or the thing would be highlighted or otherwise marked out as an <em>ad</em>.</p>
<p>Would you guys be ok with this? Or would it be  turn-off?</p>
<p>Dom and I are trying to strike a balance &#8211; and as this method of running a web site is <em>terra incognita</em> to both of us, we&#8217;d appreciate as much feedback as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, once again, <strong>THANKS!</strong> to all of you, especially those who threw some coins in our cup! You&#8217;re the reason EPautos (also now Libertariancarguy.com) is still alive and kicking.</p>

<p>It is very low production &#8211; and very high cost &#8211; and thus, rarely seen. Like a Bugatti Veyron.</p>
<p>If we were talking Bugattis, there would waiting lists; people wrangling and wheedling to get their hands on one by any means &#8211; no matter the cost.</p>
<p>But there is no trouble finding the Unwanted Exotic &#8211; and (trust me) you <em>won&#8217;t</em> pay full sticker. In fact, some are downright bargains . . .  well, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p>There is the Honda Fit electric car. You can drive one (though not very far) for the low, low rate of $259 a month. It is very exotic. Honda has only found homes for about 83 of them so far this year. This is just a bit below the hoped-for target of just over 1,000 annually (2,100 over 24 months). No doubt it has something to do with the fact that you can drive the same vehicle &#8211; without the electric motor (and so, much farther) for about $100 <em>less</em> per month. <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/26/unwanted-exotics/electric-edsel-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23453"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23453" alt="Electric Edsel picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Electric-Edsel-picture-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>GM is having similar problems with its electrified exotic, the Chevy Volt. For some impenetrable reason, it languishes unloved &#8211; and unsold.</p>
<p>GM has had to to idle the plant where they&#8217;re made. Six-plus months worth of inventory has stacked up &#8211; and the end of the calendar year is only about <em>four</em> months away. That means a lot of &#8220;new&#8221; 2013s are going to end up as last year&#8217;s leftovers before they&#8217;ve even taken the plastic covers off of the seats. GM keeps cutting the price &#8211; most recently by about $5,000 (transferring the balance to its other customers) but still, an insufficient number of rubes are sufficiently enthused.</p>
<p>Quit? Go back to the drawing board? Either option would seem to be a <em>reasonable</em> thing to do. Nah.</p>
<p>Double down!</p>
<p>Make <em>more</em> of them. Damn the torpedoes &#8211; full speed ahead!<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/26/unwanted-exotics/back-to-the-drawing-board-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23460"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23460" alt="back to the drawing board picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/back-to-the-drawing-board-picture-276x300.jpg" width="276" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If the definition of insanity is, indeed, repeating the same action over and over and over &#8211; and expecting a different result &#8211; then the car industry is palpably insane. No, wait. I am not being fair. The car industry is not insane. It is merely being <em>puppeteered</em> &#8211; dancing on strings, the strings controlled by someone else.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <em>government</em> that&#8217;s crazy. Or perhaps, crazy like a fox. If the object of this exercise is not to find a way to reduce the cost of driving but rather to <em>increase</em> it. Check this out:</p>
<p>California &#8211; the biggest single market for cars in the U.S. &#8211; along with nine others &#8211; has set quotas for Unwanted Exotics. <em>Fifteen percent of all cars sold in these states must be of the electrified variety by 2025.</em> This a great deal more than the 80-odd electric Fits Honda has sold so far. And please, no eructations about the Great Success (cue Borat voice) of Tesla. With a base price of $70,000 &#8211; $100k-plus for the one the papers like to gabble about that can (in theory) go <em>almost</em> as far on a full charge  as a $15,000 economy car with a quarter-full tank of gas &#8211; <em>volume</em> production of the Tesla is as likely as volume production of BMW M5s. Teslas are expensive toys &#8211; but unlike BMW M5s, the expense is financed by you and I and millions of our fellow tax-cattle.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/26/unwanted-exotics/tax-cattle-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23477"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23477" alt="tax cattle picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-cattle-picture-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>California, <em>et al</em> have enacted production quotas that will compel each major car company to manufacture tens of thousands of electric cars <em>each</em> &#8211; every single year. That is, they&#8217;ll be required to make more electric exotics in one year than the sum total of all of them produced to date.</p>
<p>Else punitive fines.</p>
<p>To be passed on, in one form or another, to buyers of cars that pull their own weight like the 2014 Toyota Corolla I just back from test driving in San Diego (review to be posted later this week, but I&#8217;ll have a video walk-around up today).</p>
<p>This cost-shifting is necessary because, of course, these is no means of compelling people to <em>buy</em> Unwanted Exotics.</p>
<p>Make the car companies build them, yes.</p>
<p>But then what?</p>
<p>Bailey Woods of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) told Bloomberg News the other day: &#8220;They are essentially forcing vehicles to be built and delivered to dealers who are forced to sell them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amend that. Forced to <em>try</em> to sell them.</p>
<p>Unless of course they plan to put guns to people&#8217;s heads. And these days, that&#8217;s not entirely unlikely. A coiffed and suited thug named Roland Hwang from the National Resources Defense Council &#8211; which is not per se the government but might as well be &#8211; couches his demands for state-directed violence thusly: &#8220;Both a market <em>push</em> and a market pull are needed.&#8221;<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/26/unwanted-exotics/roland-hwang-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23462"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23462" alt="Roland Hwang picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Roland-Hwang-picture-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Just once, I&#8217;d like to see a reporter ask a person such as this Hwang character: <em>And what happens if someone decides to push back?</em></p>
<p>What if my kid&#8217;s lemonade is sour and no one wants to buy it. Shall I give my neighbors &#8211; shall I give Hwang &#8211; a <em>push</em>?</p>
<p>Coiffed and and suited thugs speak softly &#8211; but carry a very big stick. Or have others in their service who do the stick-carrying (and using) on their behalf. Thus, the major car companies will do what they must and manufacture vehicles for which there is no real market. They will be made &#8211; and then they will sit. Vast fleets of build &#8216;em-or-else electric cars will be cranked out and then it will be up to the dealers to figure out a way to get rid of them that doesn&#8217;t involve selling them at a (dirty word, children close your eyes) <em>profit. </em></p>
<p>So long as they produce no emissions (well, that is, at the <em>tailpipe</em>; hush up about the emissions produced by electric utility plants, the toxic effluents associated with manufacturing hundreds of pounds of batteries) and go places (though not <em>distant</em> places) without burning any gas (just a lot of <em>dollars</em>), then bully. Make more! <em>We</em> demand it &#8211; even if there&#8217;s obviously no real demand for such animals.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/26/unwanted-exotics/dumb-ass-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23473"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23473" alt="dumb ass picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dumb-ass-picture-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>This &#8211; to a government no-good-nik (or a cartel capitalist) &#8211; is enlightened policy.</p>
<p>And it may indeed serve a real purpose. Not ours, of course. Because this level of stupidity usually isn&#8217;t. Hwang &#8211; and guys like Elon Musk &#8211; aren&#8217;t dummies. They&#8217;re <em>players</em>.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re playing us.</p>
<p><em>Throw it in the Woods</em>?</p>

<p>Not if you can help it.</p>
<p>Officer Friendly is a fiction &#8211; a vicious fable sold to schoolkids &#8211; who soon learn in one way or another that <em>any</em> interaction with a cop is a likely to be a bad interaction. You are dealing with perhaps the worst possible tag-team combination: Someone with legal power over you who is held to a different &#8211; and far more lenient &#8211; standard than you are. And therefore, you are dealing with a person who is much more likely to do things &#8211; not nice things &#8211; than you or I or any other person <em>sans</em> special costume and badge might be inclined to do. After all &#8211; why not? Especially if one is a bully &#8211; or an outright sadist &#8211; and the cop profession attracts exactly that type precisely because of the nature of the work. In its own way, giving a bully a badge is like giving a fat kid free reign at the candy store. Expecting him not to eat is almost silly.</p>
<p>But we are dealing with a thing much worse than mere gluttony.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/23/dealing-with-cops-these-days/stop-and-frisk-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23426"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23426" alt="stop and frisk picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/stop-and-frisk-picture-300x182.jpg" width="300" height="182" /></a></p>
<p>A <em>cop</em> can:</p>
<p>* Commit assault with near-impunity. He might be fired. He probably will not be. It is hard to hold him personally responsible &#8211; let alone liable. His expenses will be handled by the department, by the county &#8211; which means, you will subsidize your own abuse, even if you do win in court . A cop enjoys &#8220;sovereign immunity&#8221; by dint of his special outfit and badge.</p>
<p>* He can draw his firearm and point it at you &#8211; even shoot at you &#8211; without fear of life-altering consequences &#8211; such as a felony record for brandishing and reckless endangerment. Much less a murder rap. But if one of us should happen to kill a police <em>dog</em>&#8230;. the canine &#8220;officer&#8217;s&#8221; life is regarded by the law as more valuable than ours.</p>
<p>And, of course, if a cop shoots<em> your</em> dog. . .  .<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/23/dealing-with-cops-these-days/dnews-sslstandoff14/" rel="attachment wp-att-23433"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23433" alt="Dnews SSLStandoff14" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/no-knock-warrant-300x191.jpg" width="300" height="191" /></a></p>
<p>* He can rely on his cronies and the system to cover up or minimize his errors of judgment, even when they involve serious harm to innocent people such as yourself. Evidence can disappear &#8211; or be <em>manufactured</em>. They are professionals &#8211; a team of them. You are an amateur &#8211; and on your own.</p>
<p>* His word will be treated as legal tender in court &#8211; while <em>yours</em> is considered suspect, biased &#8211; and will probably be dismissed out-of-hand as &#8220;hearsay&#8221; by the judge.</p>
<p>His very <em>person</em> is anointed.</p>
<p>* If you strike a cop, the consequences will be certain &#8211; and severe. Even if done in self-defense against a cop who has abused his already almost limitless authority &#8211; as, for example, breaking down the wrong door during a no-knock raid.</p>
<p>* If he is harmed in any way in the course of apprehending you, there will be additional charges levied against you for this. But if <em>you</em> are injured by him &#8211; including gratuitous injuries &#8211; it is unlikely any meaningful sanctions will be applied. Perhaps a letter of reprimand will be placed in his file.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/23/dealing-with-cops-these-days/bacon-pigs-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23443"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23443" alt="bacon pigs picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bacon-pigs-picture-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>What is the lesson to take away from all of this?</p>
<p><em>Avoid cops</em>.</p>
<p>Do not engage them in conversation. They will view any questioning of their authority as a provocation. Answer &#8211; if you must &#8211; in a flat monotone. Yes. No. Am I free to go?</p>
<p>Do <em>not</em> look to them for help.</p>
<p>Something like this could be the end result:</p>
<p><iframe width="752" height="564" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xyg32CPyKNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Teach your kids to be wary of them. To view them as potentially dangerous strangers &#8211; which is exactly what they are.</p>
<p>Show signs of disgust when others refer to them as &#8220;heroes.&#8221; Do not watch Blue Porno &#8211; TV shows that lionize cops.</p>
<p>Never <em>voluntarily</em> permit one on your property, or allow him to cross the threshold and enter your home. Do not even open the door &#8211; unless you <em>must</em>.  Always remember that they are on the other side of a very important line. That notwithstanding any superficial civilities, there is impersonal, arbitrary violence behind those mirrored sunglasses.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/23/dealing-with-cops-these-days/great-white-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23431"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23431" alt="great white picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/great-white-picture-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Do, in brief, everything you can to avoid even being noticed by one &#8211; so that you can avoid having to interact with one at all.</p>
<p>Keep a low profile. Do what you must to blend in. Make sure your vehicle&#8217;s government-approval stickers and so on are up to date, that there is nothing about your vehicle (such as a burned out headlight) to give them an excuse. Run silent, run deep. At least until our odds improve. And with every day, with every new video of the truth about the nature of the relationship between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em> that gets posted on YouTube, the stories that are becoming harder and harder to suppress and dismiss, the balance shifts a little more. It will not be much longer. Until then, bide your time &#8211; and keep your head down.</p>
<p><em>This</em> will keep you safe.</p>
<p>Look upon cops in the same way a scuba diver does the sharks of the ocean. Both are opportunistic predators who can strike unpredictably, with devastating consequences. By exercising hypervigilance &#8211; and never making the mistake of thinking either is anything other than an opportunistic predator, one can minimize greatly the chances of becoming chum.</p>

Both are spiffy European-brand sport coupes with folding metal hardtops and all the bells and whistles &#8211; but the BMW <em>starts</em> at $47,600 while you can buy a new Eos for $35,195. Even a top-of-the-line Eos Executive, at $41,695, doesn&#8217;t come close to the BMW 3 coupe&#8217;s base price &#8211; yet both cars are similarly laid out and deliver a comparable open roof &#8211; or not &#8211; driving experience.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/2014-eos-side-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-23384"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23384" alt="2014 Eos side view" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2014-Eos-side-view-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Eos is <em>old</em>. It was introduced in 2007 &#8211; and hasn&#8217;t changed much since then.</p>
<p>The 2014 is &#8220;new&#8221; in model year only.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not been a strong seller for VW &#8211; and may be discontinued. Or profoundly changed next year (or the year after that). And that, in turn, could gimp resale values of the current model.</p>
<p>The Eos was launched at a time when Volkswagen was trying to reposition itself as an upscale brand more or less in the same league with cars from Audi, BMW and Volvo.</p>
<p>But the problem with that concept is that a VW isn&#8217;t a <em>BMW</em> &#8211; and convincing enough people to shell out BMW <em>money</em> for a VW has proved to be tough.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-top-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-23385"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23385" alt="Eos top down" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-top-down-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s a lot to like about the Eos &#8211; if you can get around the status issue. There aren&#8217;t many retractable hardtop coupes out there &#8211; and virtually none that are both German-made <em>and</em> which can be bought for about $35k &#8211; if you go easy on the options.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IT IS</strong></p>
<p>The Eos is a mid-sized, four-seater retractable hardtop coupe.</p>
<p>Base price is $35,195 for the Komfort trim; a top-of-the-line Executive has a sticker price of $41,695</p>
<p>All trims are are FWD and feature VW&#8217;s turbocharged 2.0 liter engine with six-speed automated manual (DSG) transmission.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S NEW<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-interior/" rel="attachment wp-att-23386"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23386" alt="Eos interior" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-interior-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The Lux trim has been dropped, simplifying the lineup.</p>
<p>The formerly available six-speed manual transmission has also been dropped. All &#8217;14 Eos trims come standard with VW&#8217;s DSG <em>automated</em> manual.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S GOOD</strong></p>
<p>Retractable hardtop looks and feels more solid than a fabric top and provides more protection from the weather &#8211; and thieves &#8211; than soft-topped competitors.</p>
<p>Luxury-car finish,materials and attention to details.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-console-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23390"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23390" alt="Eos console picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-console-picture-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Costs $12,405 less to start than a BMW 3 retractable hardtop coupe; about $6k less to start than a Volvo C70 retractable hardtop ($41,200)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S NOT SO GOOD</strong></p>
<p>Formerly available 250 hp 3.2 liter V-6 no longer is.</p>
<p>Ditto the manual transmission.</p>
<p>Retractable hardtop hardware eats up the already-small trunk.</p>
<p>BMW/Audi price tag &#8211; VW key fob.</p>
<p><strong>UNDER THE HOOD</strong></p>
<p>The &#8217;14 Eos comes standard with VW&#8217;s 2.0 liter turbocharged and intercooled four rated at 200 hp.</p>
<p>The formerly available 3.2 liter V-6 has been disappeared.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-engine/" rel="attachment wp-att-23391"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23391" alt="Eos engine" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-engine-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>So has the formerly available six-speed manual transmission. All versions now come standard with VW&#8217;s dual-clutch (DSG) six-speed automatic.</p>
<p>0-60 takes about 7.4 seconds..</p>
<p>Gas mileage  is 22 city/30 highway &#8211; which is slightly better than the BMW 328i retractable hardtop coupe, which comes standard with a 3.0 liter in-line six that rates 18 city, 28 highway. The BMW 3&#8242;s engine is stronger, though &#8211; 230 hp &#8211; and it gets to car to 60 sooner (just under 7 seconds).</p>
<p>Volvo&#8217;s C70, though, is probably the more direct &#8211; and thus, fair &#8211; comparison when it comes to drivetrain layout, because it&#8217;s FWD like the EOS and not RWD like the BMW.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/dsg-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-23393"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23393" alt="DSG picture" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSG-picture-300x154.jpg" width="300" height="154" /></a></p>
<p>It comes standard with a 2.5 liter in-line five and 227 hp. Being a bit larger &#8211; and several hundred pounds heavier (3,837 lbs. vs. 3,508 lbs. for the Eos) it is also considerably slower. The C70, despite its premium car price tag, delivers an economy car 0-60 run in the low 8 second range. This can be remedied somewhat by opting for the available Inscription Package, which includes a 250 hp version of the Volvo five &#8211; but even then, the Eos is still quicker. And the Volvo&#8217;s a lot more <em>expensive</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also thirstier: 19 city, 28 highway.</p>
<p>VW recommends premium unleaded to get the most performance (and mileage) out of the 2.0 liter engine, but doesn&#8217;t <em>require</em> it, so it&#8217;s ok to use regular if you want to save a few bucks and don&#8217;t really care if your engine is making max power at all times.</p>
<p><strong>ON THE ROAD<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-on-the-road/" rel="attachment wp-att-23387"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23387" alt="Eos on the road" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-on-the-road-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The Eos has the heart of a GTI but lags a few steps behind in the 0-60 race because of its greater curb weight, courtesy of the retractable hardtop.</p>
<p>Still, the car&#8217;s not <em>slow</em>.</p>
<p>No signs of strain accelerating from a stoplight or merging with traffic. It is a pleasant driver, with the turbo&#8217;d two providing good low-end torque in stop-and-go driving and also high-speed power when you punch it.</p>
<p>The issue for the Eos will be the inevitable comparisons with the power/performance of cars <em>in its price range</em> like the $36,900 BMW <em>128i</em> convertible. Granted it&#8217;s a soft-top. But it comes standard with a 230 hp six-cylinder engine that delivers 0-60 in a more price-appropriate 6.7 seconds.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-on-the-road-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-23399"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23399" alt="Eos on the road 2" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-on-the-road-2-300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>Or &#8211; wild card &#8211; how about the Chrysler 200 convertible? It can be ordered with a 283 hp 3.6 liter V-6 and you can get this car &#8211; <em>loaded</em> &#8211; for about $33k.</p>
<p>The Eos is caught in quandary. It&#8217;s not really a <em>sporty</em> car &#8211; it&#8217;s too heavy and it&#8217;s not packing enough heat under the hood. But many buyers are going to make comparisons with similarly priced &#8211; and sportier/better-performing &#8211; models like the BMW 1. On the other hand, Leisure World cruisers like the new Chrysler 200 deliver comparable sunny Sunday afternoon driving enjoyment &#8211; at a much lower (to start especially) ) MSRP. Meanwhile, the Volvo C70 delivers a similar retractable hardtop experience, more interior space &#8211; and upmarket brand status &#8211; for not all that much more money than you&#8217;d pay for an optioned-out Eos.</p>
<p>If the Eos could be ordered with something along the lines of the 256 hp version of the 2.0 liter engine that&#8217;s standard in the current Golf R, then it would  sporty enough to face down the BMW1, clean the Volvo&#8217;s clock and &#8211; perhaps more to the point &#8211; its pushing $40k price tag would go down a lot easier.</p>
<p>This is just my humble opinion, but I think 200 hp is too close to economy car hp. It invites comparisons VW probably would probably like to avoid.</p>
<p>Whether people actually <em>use</em> the power is largely irrelevant. It&#8217;s a question of feeling good about what you just spent a wad of cash on. And people who spend $35-$40k on a car want to know they can outrun people who spend $22k on their cars &#8211; even if they never actually do it.</p>
<p>I also mourn the loss of the formerly available six-speed manual. The now-mandatory DSG is a technological marvel and does its job superbly. But it is less <em>fun</em>. And isn&#8217;t a car like this about having fun?</p>
<p><strong>AT THE CURB<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-at-the-curb/" rel="attachment wp-att-23388"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23388" alt="Eos at the curb" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-at-the-curb-300x112.jpg" width="300" height="112" /></a></strong></p>
<p>A big problem for the Eos is its curb appeal &#8211; its attention-getting ability.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have much.</p>
<p>As with the Engine Issue, people who spend this kind of money generally <em>want</em> something more than run-of-the-mill. They want to be noticed. Or more precisely, they want people to notice what they&#8217;re they&#8217;re driving. But the Eos is a wallflower. With its almost seamless retractable hardtop in place, it easily fades into the crowd. When the similarly Shy Guy Pontiac G6 retractable hardtop was still around, VW had the edge as a nicer-than-Pontiac alternative. But given what you can get for $35k today &#8211; for a lot <em>less</em> than that, if you are ok with a soft-top rather than a retractable hardtop (see, for example, the spiffy little Mini Cooper convertible &#8211; just $25,150 &#8211; or how about a new Camaro or Mustang convertible? The Fiat 500 ragtop? Etc.) the Eos doesn&#8217;t really have anything <em>obviously</em> spectacular to counter with.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-retracting/" rel="attachment wp-att-23389"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23389" alt="Eos retracting" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-retracting-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>And it ought to.</p>
<p>Yes, the retractable hardtop is neat &#8211; especially the fact that it also has a power sunroof built in that you can use to let in some sun and breeze when you don&#8217;t feel like dropping the entire top. But what else is there? Take the retractable hardtop out of the equation and what are you left with that justifies spending $35-$41k?</p>
<p>And when you do drop the top, the trunk goes away. Literally. Small to begin with (10.5 cubic feet with the hardtop up) it shrinks to <em>5.4 cubic feet</em> when the top is folded.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-trunk/" rel="attachment wp-att-23394"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23394" alt="Eos trunk" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-trunk-300x194.jpg" width="300" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>The Chrysler 200, meanwhile, has a 13.1 cubic foot trunk; the BMW has 9 cubic feet. The C70 slots into the middle with 12.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity. None of these have huge trunks, but they are at least cargo-viable.</p>
<p>On the upside, the Eos does have usable back seats &#8211; a feature that many (cough) &#8220;two-plus-two&#8221; convertible coupes like the Camaro and Mustang don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>Second row legroom is decent: 32.5 inches vs. 31.9 for the BMW 3 retractable hardtop. Interestingly, the significantly larger (on the outside) C70 is only slightly roomier inside, with 33.9 inches of second row legroom.</p>
<p>But the Chrysler 200&#8242;s 33.5 inches in back is a counterpoint against the Eos.</p>
<p><strong>THE REST<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-interior-detail/" rel="attachment wp-att-23395"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23395" alt="Eos interior detail" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-interior-detail--300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The materials used and detail items in the Eos are &#8211; and should be &#8211; noticeably nicer than in other, lesser-priced VW models like the new Jetta, which VW recently redesigned to be less expensive than it used to be &#8211; in order to make the car more competitive &#8211; a tacit recognition that previously, it wasn&#8217;t. Or at least, was less competitive than it needed to be for VW to make adequate money off the deal, anyhow.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-backseats/" rel="attachment wp-att-23398"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23398" alt="Eos backseats" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-backseats-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I suspect that when the Eos is redesigned &#8211; if it&#8217;s redesigned &#8211; it&#8217;ll either be Jetta-ized (i.e., made more price-competitive with stuff in the under-$30k class) or its content &#8211; under the hood, especially &#8211; will be brought up to spec with the current par for cars with sticker prices in the $35-$40k range.</p>
<p>I think, personally, that the car lacks <em>focus</em> &#8211; not goodness. It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with it. It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s not enough to excite people about it. This could be done in either of two ways.</p>
<p>One, offer more performance &#8211; and &#8220;fun to drive.&#8221; Put an optional higher hp engine back in the lineup and make it available with a <em>manual</em> transmission. People love the Golf R. How about that concept with a retractable hardtop?<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-audio-detail/" rel="attachment wp-att-23396"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23396" alt="Eos audio detail" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-audio-detail-300x131.png" width="300" height="131" /></a></p>
<p>Two, make it affordable &#8211; and sell more of them.</p>
<p>I enjoyed driving the Eos. But would I pay what they&#8217;re asking?  Uh, no. But if this car cost say $28k rather than $35 to start, I&#8217;d bet a lot more people would be interested. VW would have the <em>only</em> affordable retractable hardtop in town. It would be directly competitive with all those <em>soft-tops</em> in the $30k (and less) price bracket &#8211; rather than be trying to compete with status-brand retractable hardtops in the pushing (and exceeding) $40k price bracket.</p>
<p>Put simply, it would be a value. A deal.</p>
<p>A <em>steal</em>.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-badge/" rel="attachment wp-att-23397"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23397" alt="&quot;Eos&quot; badge" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-badge-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>VW might not make money on each sale &#8211; but the halo effect might be worth it. Chevrolet reportedly makes no money selling Corvettes. But Corvettes help Chevy sell a lot of Malibus and Impalas.</p>
<p>Odds and ends: As in most German cars, the Eos has top-drawer seat heaters that can actually get <em>hot</em> as opposed to tepid. You will appreciate this when your back&#8217;s sore &#8211; or the weather&#8217;s cold outside.</p>
<p>The top drops at the touch of a button; well, the pull of a handle located on the center console, just below the armrest. The same pull handle also slides and opens the integrated sunroof.</p>
<p>The paintwork is beautiful &#8211; <em>including the door jambs and trunk underside</em>. I continue to be shocked by the number of not-inexpensive cars that cheap out on this &#8211; that have no clear-coat on the not-immediately visible areas, such as the underside of the trunk and hood and even the door jambs. It looks like <em>scheisse</em> &#8211; all to save probably no more than $20 per car during manufacturing.<a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2013/08/22/2014-vw-eos/eos-tail-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-23400"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23400" alt="Eos tail view" src="http://ericpetersautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eos-tail-view-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>To its credit, VW does not cheap out on the paint.</p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re careful about the options &#8211; and haggle yourself down from the MSRP &#8211; the Eos can be a good buy relative to a 328i or C70.</p>
<p>I just wish it were a better one.</p>

<p>Today, I am flying &#8211; the first time I have done so in almost four years. I used to fly regularly, in order to attend the &#8220;ride and drive&#8221; events hosted by the car companies. But submitting to the degradation that one must endure was enough to cause me to opt out &#8211; of flying.</p>
<p>So, why am I breaking my vow?</p>
<p>Chiefly, in order to visit my parents, who live on the other side of the country and whom I have not seen in, well, almost four years &#8211; since I opted out of flying. They are getting old and much as my teeth grind and my heart burns at the prospect, I will endure what must be endured in order to see them.</p>
<p>But, unlike all the lowing cattle at Roanoke Regional Airport today, I alone opted out of the porno scanner. I stood, appalled, as my fellow travelers queued up for their dose of radiation &#8211; and humiliation. A blue shirted cretin waved at me to come through the machine. &#8220;<em>No</em>. I will be opting out.&#8221; Frown. Uncomprehending looks from the people queued up behind me. Not one showed any signs of support. Several seemed annoyed. At <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>This defeats me.</p>
<p>The blase indifference of so many people to being treated like the scum of the earth by the scum of the earth. The easy compliance. The shrugging and so-whating. And, far worse: Their irritation with people who <em>aren&#8217;t</em> indifferent.</p>
<p>It makes me very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like submitting to a fondling in the I surrender stance. But doing it gums up their works a little at least. it slows down the process; makes life a bit more difficult &#8211; for them. When I think how easy it would be to really throw a monkey wrench in their works &#8211; peacefully, according to their rules. . . and yet, almost no one seems willing. They queue up for the radiation-porno scanner and by doing so have routinized that &#8211; on top of all the <em>other</em> affronts they&#8217;ve already routinized by their  shameful acquiescence.</p>
<p>If they won&#8217;t make the effort here &#8211; now &#8211; in this little, nearly cost-free way &#8211; what are the chances they&#8217;ll ever take a stand for liberty?</p>
<p>Most normal people mourn the death of a loved one. Most Americans don&#8217;t even notice that America has died.</p>
<p>Much less give a tinker&#8217;s damn that it has.</p>

<p>For some time now heavily covered and padded 2015 Mustangs have been spotted around the country in testing. Now that has changed, a car was spotted without anything covering the front clip. The internet is abuzz with how Fusion like it is. But look closely, those must be Fusion parts.</p>
<p>If I were an engineer at Ford and in the position to do it, what I would do is take one of the mules and bolt on all the Fusion (or some other Ford) front body panels. Then I would run it where someone would get a picture of it. It&#8217;s just too funny to pass up doing it. So that&#8217;s exactly what I think someone at Ford did here.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great. The Mustang Forums are buzzing. People are arguing amongst themselves if the Fusion look is good or not. If I&#8217;m right, this should be the automotive troll of the year.</p>

<p>Terrible things are happening faster than we can keep up with them. Monsanto, widely regarded as a criminal enterprise, is expanding its monopoly over seeds and food production into Chile and Latin America. <a href="http://rt.com/news/chile-protest-monsanto-law-634/" target="_blank">http://rt.com/news/chile-protest-monsanto-law-634/</a> Monsanto has given up for now on monopolizing Europe’s agriculture, but has brought the EU around to allowing it to market GMO food products. Money speaks, which perhaps is the reason that Chile’s former president, Michelle Bachelet, introduced the pro-Monsanto legislation that one of the legislative chambers has passed. There are mass demonstrations in Chile against the legislation that destroys Chile’s sovereignty over its food production, but just as Monsanto can purchase the US government it also can purchase the Chilean government. In our day and time, governments are just another commodity to be bought and sold by powerful corporations.</p>

<p>As soon as Egypt gets a democracy with an elected president, Washington has the military, which is dependent on Washington for money and equipment, to overthrow the democracy, just as Washington does in Honduras and elsewhere. The Egyptian government that democracy produced was Islamist. The Muslim Brotherhood is moderate, not radical, but the moderate Islamists showed lack of enthusiasm for supporting the Washington-Israeli policy of genocide for Palestine. Washington finds “freedom and democracy” unacceptable when it does not support Washington’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>This fall Congress will again be confronted with the debt ceiling limit. To keep this specter at bay, the US Treasury has been employing questionable means. The crisis that has been kicked down the road is likely to worsen, because the economy is likely to renew its decline in ways that cannot be disguised by manipulated statistics. Sooner or later the world will realize that the US cannot pay its bills and that the world’s reserve currency is being ruthlessly printed in order to prop up busted banks and the US Treasury. The house of cards that US economic policy has constructed in the 21st century can collapse at any time.</p>
<p>Since so much that is distressing awaits us, I propose a bit of respite and in this column<br />
take us back to happier times.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Up In America</strong><br />
<em>cars make a difference</em></p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts</p>
<p>It was 1955 when I came of driving age. What a glorious year on the automotive scene. The first V-8 engined Chevrolet appeared in the striking art work of the 1955 Bel Air hard top coupe. Often two-toned, usually pastels, this car, stock from the dealer, had the acceleration to match the souped up flathead V-8 Ford engines that were ensconced in the hot rods of the day.</p>
<p>The small block V-8 found its way into the Corvette, saving the Corvette from extinction.</p>
<p>Ford came out with its new overhead valve V-8, installed in the 1955 Thunderbird, still a show-stopper today. The Thunderbird existed as a two-seater for 3 years. The 1955 and 1956 Ford Fairlane hard top coup looked like it was doing sixty sitting still.</p>
<p>The dramatic styling and energetic engines appeared everywhere in Detroit’s lineup, in the Mercury, the Pontiac, Oldsmobile, the Buick Century. So many two-tones, acceleration times cut in half. Life was good.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Chrysler produced the 1955 Chrysler 300 with a 300 horsepower Hemi engine. This car was the high speed king, reaching 130 mph. In 1956 the 300 Hemi delivered 355 horsepower capable of 140 mph. By 1957 the 300 Hemi produced 390 horsepower, outrunning the Ferraris of the day.</p>
<p>Every style of every marque was distinctive. There was no mistaking one model for another. Driving on city streets and country highways was a feast for the eyes. Style and color were everywhere.</p>
<p>Even in those days driving occupied much of a person’s time. To be among striking designs and color combinations that excited the imagination was good for the psyche. We were a different people.</p>
<p>Decades ago a rare piece of fiction in Road &amp; Track resulted in a premonition of the brutal and indistinguishable appearance of today’s SUVs and oversized pickup trucks.</p>
<p>It was the only piece of fiction, aside from a cartoon strip feature, that I recall ever appearing in R&amp;T. The magazine is about road tests, car reports, and race results.</p>
<p>Perhaps the explanation for the fictional story is that a prescient car guy realized the brutal design implications of the looming car safety standards and wrote a story set in the future.</p>
<p>In the story, a man has a lovely sports car from the past that, unlike the mandated safety vehicles, is fun to drive, but he can no longer take it out during normal hours. Under federal safety mandates, vehicles had become massive hulks, brutal in appearance, and capable of smashing the cars of the past without injury to themselves or their drivers. Drivers of the safe machines patrol on the lookout for cars from an earlier, more elegant time. It was a sport to corner them and to crash into them, thus terminating their existence and removing the offense to the ugliness of the safe cars mandated by the government.</p>
<p>To avoid the demise of his car, he only took it out at 3:00 AM in order to avoid encounters with safe cars. But one early morning two of the hulks were waiting for him. The safe cars approached from both ends of the road, leaving him no way out. But the agility of his car and his skills as a driver permit his escape. Henceforth his enjoyment of his car is confined to visits in the garage and memories of past drives.</p>
<p>I don’t remember if the story was illustrated or whether the image of the SUV was created by the writer’s words, but years later when I saw the first SUV, now with names, such as Titan, to go with their brutal appearance, I instantly recalled the R&amp;T story.</p>
<p>The young have no memory of the past. They cannot know how exciting automobiles once were. The excitement created by the explosion of styles, colors, and performance in 1955 is gone from the world. It was a 15-year experience, with the muscle cars of the 1960s keeping the thrill alive.</p>
<p>When the Jaguar E-Type appeared in 1961, no one could believe that such an extraordinarily beautiful and fast car could be had for $5,000. Enzo Ferrari, the master car-maker of all time, declared the E-Type to be the most beautiful car in the world. One sits in permanent exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Who could imagine a SUV being there, or an over-sized pick-up truck? If we had called for our Saturday night dates in such vehicles, our dates would have been mortified and would have refused to come out of the house.</p>
<p>Anyone who has sat in the driver’s seat of an E-Type, the first modern car with all independent suspension and 4-wheel disc brakes, looking over the long and louvered bonnet (hood), and starting the powerful engine with its Jaguar growl finds today’s vehicles utterly depressing.</p>
<p>Another extraordinary design of the era was the Lamborghini Miura. It came 5 years after the E-Type and was an equal show-stopper.</p>
<p>Today if you have a quarter of a million dollars to spend on a car, you can purchase cars that can outperform these icons of the 1960s. But if you drive up in your Audi A-8, your AMG Mercedes, your Porsche turbo, your Ferrari Italia, the audience will flock to the E-Type and to the Miura. Style, when it was not dictated by Washington, was brilliant. There will never again be anything like it.</p>
<p>Today cars from the fifties and sixties, including the 1954 Oldsmobile Super 88 coupe, if in reasonable condition, are more valuable than most new cars. A good Miura goes for $1 million. A Series 1 E-Type, produced in much larger numbers than the Miura, goes for $125,000 if in good condition. I have a friend who in the mid-1960s bought and sold for $9,000 a Ferrari 250 GTO. This Ferrari, an aggressive and beautiful take-off on the elegant E-Type, won the world championship for three years in the early 1960s. There were only about 36 of them produced. One sold recently for $35 million. Try to imagine, short of dollar hyperinflation, any vehicle of our time ever fetching $35 million as a used car.</p>
<p>Seeing a car, rather than a SUV or monster pick-up truck, is becoming a rare event. Recently, I made a count on a stretch of Interstate highway, and 75% of the traffic consisted of SUVs and over-sized pick-up trucks. Americans want to appear brutal like their vehicles, and their police, and their governments.</p>
<p>SUVs were an unintended consequence of federally mandated fleet gas milage standards. Auto makers complied with the mandate by eliminating station wagons. People looking for station wagon replacement settled on delivery vans and panel trucks. These vehicles, classified as light trucks, were exempt from the gas milage standards, and the SUV was born.</p>
<p>The unintended consequence of safety standards is to take beauty out of almost all vehicles. How many attractive vehicles do you see today? I recently made a 370 mile trip and saw one car worthy of notice. It was a $300,000 600HP Bentley coupe, a rare and unusual car. When I came of driving age, beautiful and colorful cars emitting wonderful sounds were everywhere. We were surrounded by them. They were Chevrolets and Fords. They weren’t for the mega-rich. The working class could afford them.</p>
<p>Think about this for a minute. People spend much of their lives in passenger vehicles. They commute to work and back to home. They travel to shop. They travel to vacation destinations. They take children to school and back to home. All of this time that they spend in vehicles they never see anything beautiful or artistic unless some unusual remnant from the past or a rare modern day supercar, whose cost exceeds their lifetime earnings, happens by.</p>
<p>This was not true in my day. We were surrounded by color, style, and attractive designs. Literally everyone could afford it. The epitome of style was the two-door hard top coupe. Such a vehicle would cost, perhaps, $400 more than the base model that lacked the elegant touches.</p>
<p>Today, in our brutalized transportation existence, in which no make or model can be identified from any other and in which a two-tone paint job doesn’t exist, anyone with a collection of 1950s and 1960s two-door hard top coupes is a wealthy person not merely in money but also in spirit.</p>
<p>Today a person with a beautiful car from the past does not yet have to worry about being chased down and destroyed by a modern safe-car hulk, but he has to worry about where he parks it. Beauty and style elevate. Ugliness uglifies. People who drive barbarian cars can themselves become barbarians.</p>
<p>Terrible things happened in the 1950s and 1960s. McCarthyism got loose for a short period. President John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby were murdered, as was Martin Luther King, perhaps by their own government. The reliance on fear to keep the profitable cold war going and the elimination of those who would change course are antecedents of the present. We still suffer from them.</p>
<p>The difference is that then enough Americans had a frame of mind that had space for the optimism that permitted blacks to be legislated into full citizenship and for the protests that brought to an end the military/security complex’s profitable aggression in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Perhaps elegant cars had a civilizing influence and contributed to that frame of mind. Get Washington out of car design. It might help to restore our humanity from the brutality that surrounds us.</p>
