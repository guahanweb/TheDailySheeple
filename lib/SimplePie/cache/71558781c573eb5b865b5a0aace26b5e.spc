<p>If the 233 billion barrel figure is accurate (and some have even suggested that the true number could actually be 400 billion barrels), that would make it nearly 10 times larger than the Bakken formation, 17 times larger than the Marcellus discovery and 80 times larger than the Eagle Ford deposit down in Texas.</p>
<p>It would also mean that Australia now has more "black gold" than the nations of Iran, Iraq, Canada and Venezuela.</p>
<p>The closest town to this oil discovery, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coober_Pedy#Oil_reserves">Coober Pedy</a>, is in the process of being totally transformed.  It normally only has about 1,700 inhabitants, but news of this discovery has drawn in 20,000 additional people already and real estate prices in the town are absolutely skyrocketing.</p>
<p>So does all of this mean that gas prices will go down soon?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately that is not likely to be the case.</p>
<p>First of all, the oil in this formation in Australia is going to be quite expensive to extract.  It has been estimated that it is going to cost <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-24/major-oil-discovery-in-outback-sa/4481982">up to 300 million dollars</a> just to get this site ready for production.</p>
<p>In addition, many of our politicians are absolutely determined to greatly punish the use of oil because they believe that it is the primary cause of global warming.  So they continue to raise taxes on gasoline consumption.</p>
<p>Today, motorists in the United States pay an average of <a href="http://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas-overview/industry-economics/fuel-taxes/gasoline-tax">49.5 cents</a> of taxes per gallon of gasoline, and in the state of California motorists pay an average of <a href="http://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas-overview/industry-economics/fuel-taxes/gasoline-tax">71.9 cents</a> of taxes per gallon of gasoline.</p>
<p>Hopefully the price of gasoline will come down a bit over the next few years, but even if it does I would not expect it to come down too much.</p>
<p>But what we can be sure of is that the world is not going to run out of oil any time soon.  Those that have been predicting that we are are on the verge of an "energy doomsday" can take a rest for a while.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is funny to look back and remember some of the ridiculous things that our politicians were saying about oil in the old days.  For example, U.S. President Jimmy Carter made the following statement back in 1977….</p>
<blockquote><p>"Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption, we now believe that early in the 1980s the world will be demanding more oil than it can produce".</p></blockquote>
<p>That prediction didn't exactly work out for him did it?</p>
<p>It is time that the American people were told the truth about our energy situation, and the truth is that we have plenty of energy resources.  The following stats have been updated from one of my <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-united-states-has-plenty-of-oil-10-facts-about-americas-energy-resources-that-will-blow-your-mind">previous articles</a>...</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> Back in 1995, the U.S. Geological Survey told the American people that the Bakken Shale formation in western North Dakota and eastern Montana only held 151 million barrels of oil.  Today, government officials are admitting that it holds <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-30/bakken-three-forks-has-more-oil-than-2008-estimate-usgs.html">7.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil</a>, and some analysts believe that the actual number could be closer to <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/3038120/posts">24 billion</a> barrels of oil.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> It is estimated that there are <a title="19 billion" href="http://news.investors.com/article/604303/201203141303/oil-abundant-in-the-united-states.htm" target="_blank">19 billion</a> barrels of recoverable oil in the tar sands of Utah.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> It is estimated that there are <a title="86 billion" href="http://news.investors.com/article/604303/201203141303/oil-abundant-in-the-united-states.htm" target="_blank">86 billion</a> barrels of recoverable oil in the Outer Continental Shelf.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> It is believed that there are <a title="800 billion" href="http://news.investors.com/article/604303/201203141303/oil-abundant-in-the-united-states.htm" target="_blank">800 billion</a> barrels of recoverable oil in the Green River formation in Wyoming.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Overall, the United States is sitting on approximately <a title="1.442 trillion" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-19/markets/31210459_1_oil-reserves-barrels-public-hearings" target="_blank">1.442 trillion</a> barrels of recoverable oil.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> According to the Institute of Energy Research, the United States has an <a href="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/infographics/">88 year supply</a> of natural gas.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> According to the Institute of Energy Research, the United States has a <a href="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/infographics/">169 year supply</a> of oil.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> According to the Institute of Energy Research, the United States has a <a href="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/infographics/">465 year supply</a> of coal.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Goldman Sachs is predicting that the United States will be the number one oil producing country in the world <a title="by the year 2017" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-09-15/markets/30158293_1_crude-oil-permian-lrg" target="_blank">by the year 2017</a>.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that we have plenty of energy resources.  We do not need to be importing oil from OPEC or anyone else.</p>
<p>But just because we are not going to run out of oil, natural gas or coal any time soon does not mean that we should not be developing alternative energy resources.  We should definitely be seeking ways to produce energy more cheaply, more cleanly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>If America does not end up leading the world in developing new forms of energy, we should be ashamed of ourselves.  And right now, the Chinese appear <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9784044/China-blazes-trail-for-clean-nuclear-power-from-thorium.html">to be way ahead of us</a> as far as thorium energy is concerned, and Italian scientists appear to be ahead of our own scientists <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45153076/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/italian-cold-fusion-machine-passes-another-test/#.Ue8fum0pgw4">in developing "cold fusion" technology</a>.</p>
<p>So yes, let's be glad that we are not going to be facing a crippling energy crisis in this generation, but let's also not be complacent.  There are lots of new technologies out there just waiting to be developed, and the rewards are going to go to those that are able to develop them first.</p>

<p>What is going on in Detroit right now is a perfect example of what will soon be happening all over the nation.  Many city workers stuck with their jobs for decades because of the promise of a nice pension at the end of the rainbow.  But now those promises are going up in smoke.  There has even been talk that retirees will only end up getting about 10 cents for every dollar that they were promised.</p>
<p>Needless to say, many pensioners are extremely angry that the promises that were made to them are not going to be kept.  The following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/us/cries-of-betrayal-as-detroit-plans-to-cut-pensions.html">in the New York Times</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Many retirees see the plan to cut their pensions as a betrayal, saying that they kept their end of a deal but that the city is now reneging. Retired city workers, police officers and 911 operators said in interviews that the promise of reliable retirement income had helped draw them to work for the City of Detroit in the first place, even if they sometimes had to accept smaller salaries or work nights or weekends.</p>
<p>“Does Detroit have a problem?” asked William Shine, 76, a retired police sergeant. “Absolutely. Did I create it? I don’t think so. They made me some promises, and I made them some promises. I kept my promises. They’re not going to keep theirs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But Detroit is far from an isolated case.  As <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-21/detroit-mayor-warns-we-may-be-one-first-we-absolutely-wont-be-last">Detroit Mayor Dave Bing</a> said the other day, many other cities are heading down the exact same path...</p>
<blockquote><p>"We may be one of the first. We are the largest. But we absolutely will not be the last."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Detroit's financial problems are immense.  But other major U.S. cities are facing unfunded pension liabilities that are even worse.</p>
<p>For example, here are the unfunded pension liabilities for <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/07/how-far-behind-detroit-are-finance.html">four financially-troubled large U.S. cities</a>...</p>
<p>Detroit: $3.5 billion</p>
<p>Baltimore: $680 million</p>
<p>Los Angeles: $9.4 billion</p>
<p>Chicago: $19 billion</p>
<p>When you break it down on a per citizen basis, Detroit is actually in better shape than the others...</p>
<p>Detroit: $7,145</p>
<p>Baltimore: $7,247</p>
<p>Los Angeles: $8,437</p>
<p>Chicago: $13,355</p>
<p>And many state governments are in similar shape.  Right now, the state of Illinois has unfunded pension liabilities that total approximately <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2013/0721/Detroit-bankruptcy-Is-it-a-warning-sign-for-America-video">$100 billion</a>.</p>
<p>There are some financial "journalists" out there that are attempting to downplay this problem, but sticking our heads in the sand is not going to make any of this go away.</p>
<p>According to Northwestern University Professor John Rauh, the total amount of <strong>unfunded</strong> pension and healthcare obligations for retirees that state and local governments across the United States have accumulated is <a title="4.4 trillion dollars" href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/02/16/the_state_and_local_pension_crisis_99520.html" target="_blank">4.4 trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>So where are they going to get that money?</p>
<p>They are going to raise your taxes of course.</p>
<p>Just check out what is happening right now in <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/pel-scranton-could-be-looking-at-18-million-deficit-117-percent-tax-hike-in-2014-1.1523602#.UeuvVPhPm98.email">Scranton, Pennsylvania</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Scranton taxpayers could face a 117 percent increase in taxes next year as the city's finances continue to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>A new analysis by the Pennsylvania Economy League projects an $18 million deficit for 2014, an amount so massive it outpaces the approximate $17 million the struggling city collects annually</p></blockquote>
<p>A 117 percent tax increase?</p>
<p>What would Dwight Schrute think of that?</p>
<p>Perhaps you are reading this and you are assuming that your retirement is secure because you work in the private sector.</p>
<p>Well, just remember what happened to your 401k during the financial crisis of 2008.  During the next major stock market crash, your 401k will likely get absolutely shredded.  Many Americans will probably see the value of their 401k accounts go down by 50 percent or more.</p>
<p>And if you have stashed your retirement funds with the wrong firm, you could end up losing <strong>everything</strong>.  Just ask anyone that had their nest eggs invested with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Global">MF Global</a>.</p>
<p>But of course most Americans are woefully behind on saving for retirement anyway.  A study conducted by Boston College's Center for Retirement Research found that American workers <a title="are $6.6 trillion short" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39177278" target="_blank">are $6.6 trillion short</a> of what they need to retire comfortably.</p>
<p>That certainly isn't good news.</p>
<p>On top of everything else, the federal government has been recklessly irresponsible as far as planning for the retirement of the Baby Boomers is concerned.</p>
<p>As I noted <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash">yesterday</a>, the U.S. government is facing a total of <a title="222 trillion dollars" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html" target="_blank">222 trillion dollars</a> in unfunded liabilities.  Social Security and Medicare make up the bulk of that.</p>
<p>At this point, the number of Americans on Medicare is projected to grow from a little bit more than 50 million today to <a title="73.2 million" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/231267/is-america-running-out-of-doctors" target="_blank">73.2 million</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>The number of Americans collecting Social Security benefits is projected to grow from about 56 million today to <a title="91 million" href="http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-08-20-PNI0820wirSocial-SecurityOptionsADV20_ST_U.htm" target="_blank">91 million</a> in 2035.</p>
<p>How is a society with a steadily declining economy going to care for them all adequately?</p>
<p>Yes, we truly are careening toward disaster.</p>
<p>If you are not convinced yet, here are some more numbers.  The following stats are from one of my previous articles entitled "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/do-you-want-to-scare-a-baby-boomer">Do You Want To Scare A Baby Boomer?</a>"...</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right now, there are somewhere around 40 million senior citizens in the United States.  By 2050 that number is projected to skyrocket to <a title="89 million" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/06/opinion/la-oe-gelinas-baby-boomers-retire-20111106" target="_blank">89 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> According to one recent poll, <a title="25 percent" href="http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-02-2011/many_boomers_report_no_savings_at_all.html?cmp=BAC-OUTBRAIN-WORK_9041529_Boomers-Report-No-Savings-at-All" target="_blank">25 percent</a> of all Americans in the 46 to 64-year-old age bracket have no retirement savings at all.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a title="26 percent" href="http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-02-2011/many_boomers_report_no_savings_at_all.html?cmp=BAC-OUTBRAIN-WORK_9041529_Boomers-Report-No-Savings-at-All" target="_blank">26 percent</a> of all Americans in the 46 to 64-year-old age bracket have no personal savings whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> One survey that covered all American workers found that <a title="46 percent" href="http://www.ebri.org/pdf/surveys/rcs/2011/FS2_RCS11_Prepare_FINAL1.pdf" target="_blank">46 percent</a> of them have less than $10,000 saved for retirement.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> According to a survey conducted <a title="by the Employee Benefit Research Institute" href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/10/14/america-looming-retirement-crisis/" target="_blank">by the Employee Benefit Research Institute</a>, "60 percent of American workers said the total value of their savings and investments is less than $25,000".</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> A Pew Research survey found that <a title="half of all Baby Boomers" href="http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-02-2011/many_boomers_report_no_savings_at_all.html?cmp=BAC-OUTBRAIN-WORK_9041529_Boomers-Report-No-Savings-at-All" target="_blank">half of all Baby Boomers</a> say that their household financial situations have deteriorated over the past year.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <a title="67 percent" href="http://www.streetauthority.com/income-investing/15-reasons-us-retirement-crisis-even-worse-you-think-460074" target="_blank">67 percent</a> of all American workers believe that they "are a little or a lot behind schedule on saving for retirement".</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Today, <a title="One out of every six" href="http://www.ncoa.org/press-room/press-release/one-in-six-seniors-lives-in.html" target="_blank">one out of every six</a> elderly Americans lives below the federal poverty line.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> More elderly Americans than ever are finding that they must continue working once they reach their retirement years.  Between 1985 and 2010, the percentage of Americans in the 65 to 69-year-old age bracket that were still working increased <a title="from 18 percent to 32 percent" href="http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-02-2011/many_boomers_report_no_savings_at_all.3.html" target="_blank">from 18 percent to 32 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Back in 1991, half of all American workers planned to retire before they reached the age of 65.  Today, that number has declined to <a title="23 percent" href="http://www.ebri.org/pdf/FFE.195.04Apr11.RCS-Delay.Final.pdf" target="_blank">23 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> According to one recent survey, <a title="70 percent" href="http://www.streetauthority.com/income-investing/15-reasons-us-retirement-crisis-even-worse-you-think-460074" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of all American workers expect to continue working once they are "retired".</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> According to a poll conducted by AARP, <a title="40 percent of them" href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2039804-2,00.html" target="_blank">40 percent</a> of all Baby Boomers plan to work "until they drop".</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> A poll conducted by CESI Debt Solutions found that <a title="56 percent" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/12/22/more-seniors-cart-credit-card-debt-to-grave.html" target="_blank">56 percent</a> of American retirees still had outstanding debts when they retired.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Elderly Americans tend to carry much higher balances on their credit cards than younger Americans do.  The following is from a recent <a title="CNBC article" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100384316/" target="_blank">CNBC article</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>New research from the AARP also shows that those ages 50 and over are carrying higher balances on their credit cards -- $8,278 in 2012 compared to $6,258 for the under-50 population.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>15.</strong> A study by a law professor at the University of Michigan found that Americans that are 55 years of age or older now account for <a title="20 percent" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/no-jobs-no-hope-no-future-27-signs-that-americas-poverty-class-is-rapidly-becoming-larger-than-americas-middle-class" target="_blank">20 percent</a> of all bankruptcies in the United States.  Back in 2001, they only accounted for 12 percent of all bankruptcies.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> Between 1991 and 2007 the number of Americans between the ages of 65 and 74 that filed for bankruptcy rose by a staggering <a title="178 percent" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/for-millions-of-senior-citizens-the-only-future-they-have-to-look-forward-to-is-one-filled-with-debt-and-poverty" target="_blank">178 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> What is causing most of these bankruptcies among the elderly?  The number one cause is medical bills.  According to a report published in The American Journal of Medicine, medical bills are a major factor in <a title="more than 60 percent" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH" target="_blank">more than 60 percent</a> of the personal bankruptcies in the United States.  Of those bankruptcies that were caused by medical bills, approximately 75 percent of them involved individuals that actually did have health insurance.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> In 1945, there were <a title="42 workers" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-01-12/guest-post-social-security-system-already-broke" target="_blank">42 workers</a> for every retiree receiving Social Security benefits.  Today, that number has fallen to <a title="2.5 workers" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-01-12/guest-post-social-security-system-already-broke" target="_blank">2.5 workers</a>, and if you eliminate all government workers, that leaves only 1.6 private sector workers for every retiree receiving Social Security benefits.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> Millions of elderly Americans these days are finding it very difficult to survive on just a Social Security check.  The truth is that most Social Security checks simply are not that large.  The following comes directly from <a title="the Social Security Administration" href="http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/%7E/average-monthly-social-security-benefit-for-a-retired-worker" target="_blank">the Social Security Administration website</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired worker was about $1,230 at the beginning of 2012. This amount changes monthly based upon the total amount of all benefits paid and the total number of people receiving benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can view the rest of the statistics <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/do-you-want-to-scare-a-baby-boomer">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, most Americans are not aware of these things.</p>
<p>The mainstream media keeps most of the population entertained with distractions.  This week it is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/22/world/europe/uk-royal-baby/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">the birth of the royal baby</a>, and next week it will be something else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our problems just continue to get worse and worse.</p>
<p>There is no way in the world that we are going to be able to keep all of the financial promises that we have made to the Baby Boomers.  A lot of them are going to end up bitterly disappointed.</p>
<p>All of this could have been avoided if we would have planned ahead as a society.</p>

<p>Posted below is the chart that I was talking about.  The blue line is our total debt, and the red line is our GDP.  As you can see, this chart kind of speaks for itself...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash/total-debt-growth-vs-gdp-growth" rel="attachment wp-att-6127"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6127" alt="Total Debt Growth vs. GDP Growth" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Total-Debt-Growth-vs.-GDP-Growth-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>So how did we get here?</p>
<p>Well, of course the federal government has been the biggest offender.  It would be a tremendous understatement to say that the politicians in Washington D.C. have been reckless.  Since the year 2000, the size of the U.S. national debt has grown <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade">by more than 11 trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Posted below is a chart that demonstrates the dramatic growth of the national debt as a percentage of GDP.  In particular, our debt has absolutely exploded as a percentage of GDP since the financial crisis of 2008...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash/national-debt-as-a-percentage-of-gdp" rel="attachment wp-att-6126"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6126" alt="National Debt As A Percentage Of GDP" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/National-Debt-As-A-Percentage-Of-GDP-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>Does that look sustainable to you?</p>
<p>Of course it isn't.</p>
<p>Right now, the mainstream media is very excited that the federal budget deficit for this year might be less than a trillion dollars, but they are really missing the point.  The debt of the U.S. government is still growing much, much faster than the economy is, and the United States already has more government debt <a title="per capita" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/sites/all/files/images/-1.img_assist_custom-640x421.png" target="_blank">per capita</a> than Greece, Portugal, Italy, Ireland or Spain.</p>
<p>What we are doing to future generations is absolutely criminal.  We are piling up mountains of debt that will haunt them for the rest of their lives just so that we can make the present a little bit more pleasant for ourselves.</p>
<p>As I noted in <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-statistics-about-the-fall-of-the-u-s-economy-that-are-almost-too-crazy-to-believe">another article</a>, during Obama's first term the federal government accumulated more debt than it did under <a title="the first 42 U.S presidents combined" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-obama-increased-debt-50521-household-more-first-42-presidents-53-terms" target="_blank">the first 42 U.S presidents combined</a>.  And now we are entering a time period when demographic forces are going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the finances of the federal government.</p>
<p>The Baby Boomers have started to retire, and they are going to want to start collecting on all of the financial promises that we have made to them.</p>
<p>As I have written about <a title="the other day" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/11-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-heading-straight-down-the-toilet" target="_blank">previously</a>, the number of Americans on Medicare is projected to grow from a little bit more than 50 million today to <a title="73.2 million" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/231267/is-america-running-out-of-doctors" target="_blank">73.2 million</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>The number of Americans collecting Social Security benefits is projected to grow from about 56 million today to <a title="91 million" href="http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-08-20-PNI0820wirSocial-SecurityOptionsADV20_ST_U.htm" target="_blank">91 million</a> in 2035.</p>
<p>Where are we going to get the money to pay for all of that?</p>
<p>Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff has calculated that the U.S. government is facing unfunded liabilities of <a title="222 trillion dollars" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html" target="_blank">222 trillion dollars</a> in the years ahead.</p>
<p>There is no simply no way that the U.S. government is going to be able to meet those obligations without wildly printing up money.</p>
<p>And of course the federal government is not the only one with massive debt problems.  We just saw <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-facts-about-the-fall-of-detroit-that-will-leave-you-shaking-your-head">the city of Detroit go bankrupt</a>, and there are lots of other communities all over the nation that could soon follow.</p>
<p>Posted below is a chart that shows the growth of state and local government debt over the years.  In particular, please take note that the total amount of state and local government debt has grown from about 1.2 trillion dollars in the year 2000 to about 3 trillion dollars today...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash/state-and-local-government-debt-4" rel="attachment wp-att-6125"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6125" alt="State And Local Government Debt" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/State-And-Local-Government-Debt-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>But the chart posted above does not even take into account the massive unfunded pension obligations that state and local governments are facing.  According to <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/">the Detroit Free Press</a>, state governments are facing unfunded pension obligations of nearly a trillion and a half dollars...</p>
<blockquote><p>From Baltimore to Los Angeles, and many points in between, municipalities are increasingly confronted with how to pay for these massive promises. The Pew Center for the States, in Washington, estimated states’ public pension plans across the U.S. were underfunded by a whopping $1.4 trillion in 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>And many large cities are dealing with similar situations.  Detroit was the first to go down, but could <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/">Chicago or Los Angeles</a> eventually be forced to declare bankruptcy too?...</p>
<blockquote><p>Chicago recently saw its credit rating downgraded because of a $19-billion unfunded pension liability that the ratings service Moody’s puts closer to $36 billion. And Los Angeles could be facing a liability of more than $30 billion, by some estimates.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a report that was released earlier this year, the largest U.S. cities are facing <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/">hundreds of billions of dollars</a> in unfunded pension liabilities at this point...</p>
<blockquote><p>Early this year, the Pew Center released a survey showing that 61 of the nation’s largest cities — limiting the survey to the largest city in each state and all other cities with more than 500,000 people — had a gap of more than $217 billion in unfunded pension and health care liabilities. While cities had long promised health care, life insurance and other benefits to retirees, “few ... started saving to cover the long-term costs,” the report said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where will all of that money come from?</p>
<p>That is a good question, and nobody has an easy answer at this point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have been racking up staggering amounts of debt over the past several decades.  Just consider the following numbers...</p>
<p>-Total home mortgage debt in the United States is now <a title="about 5 times larger" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/30-charts-you-must-see-before-buying-a-home-2011-4#-8" target="_blank">about 5 times larger</a> than it was just 20 years ago.</p>
<p>-Car loans just keep getting longer and longer, and approximately <a title="70 percent" href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/Howard_Dayton060506.aspx" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of all car purchases in the United States now involve an auto loan.</p>
<p>-The total amount of student loan debt in America recently surpassed <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-student-loan-debt-bubble-is-creating-millions-of-modern-day-serfs">the one trillion dollar mark</a>.</p>
<p>-One study discovered that <a title="approximately 41 percent" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/cf-7mu081908.php" target="_blank">approximately 41 percent</a> of all working age Americans either have medical bill problems or are currently paying off medical debt, and according to a report published in The American Journal of Medicine medical bills are a major factor in <a title="more than 60 percent" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH" target="_blank">more than 60 percent</a> of the personal bankruptcies in the United States.</p>
<p>-Consumer debt in the United States has risen by a whopping <a title="1700%" href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article31784.html" target="_blank">1700%</a> since 1971, and <a title="46% of all Americans" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/moneybuilder/2010/06/24/one-big-difference-between-chinese-and-american-households-debt/" target="_blank">46% of all Americans</a> carry a credit card balance from month to month.</p>
<p>Sadly, most people don't realize how damaging credit card debt can be.  If you just carry an "average balance" on your credit cards each month, and those credit cards have just an "average" interest rate, you could end up paying <a title="millions of dollars" href="http://www.bankers-anonymous.com/uncategorized/part-iii-compound-interest-and-consumer-debt/#_ftn2" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a> to the credit card companies by the end of your life...</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say you are an average American household, and you carry an average balance of $15,956 in credit card debt.</p>
<p>Also, as an average American household, let’s assume you pay an average current rate of 12.83%.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s assume you carry this average balance for 40 years, between ages 25 and 65.  How much did your credit card company make off of you and your extreme averageness?</p>
<p>Answer: $2,629,618.64</p></blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, a large percentage of the population does not seem to understand these things.  An astounding <a title="43 percent" href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/Howard_Dayton060506.aspx" target="_blank">43 percent</a> of all American families spend more than they earn each year.</p>
<p>Are you starting to understand why <a title="approximately half of all Americans" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/american-senior-citizens-die-broke-study-article-1.1130662" target="_blank">approximately half of all Americans</a> die broke?</p>
<p>We are a nation that is completely and addicted to debt.</p>
<p>If you do not believe that it will ever catch up with us you are being delusional.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> At this point, the city of Detroit owes money <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10190640/Motor-City-Detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-with-100000-creditors.html">to more than 100,000 creditors</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Detroit is facing <a title="$20 billion" href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/06/14/detroit-emergency-manager-proposes-plan-to-creditors/" target="_blank">$20 billion</a> in debt and unfunded liabilities.  That breaks down to more than $25,000 per resident.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Back in 1960, the city of Detroit actually had the <a title="highest per-capita income" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/03/23/detroit-is-dying-quickly/" target="_blank">highest per-capita income</a> in the entire nation.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> In 1950, there were <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-19/detroits-demise-one-chart">about 296,000</a> manufacturing jobs in Detroit.  Today, there are <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-19/detroits-demise-one-chart">less than 27,000</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Between <a title="December 2000 and December 2010" href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/02/267889/" target="_blank">December 2000 and December 2010</a>, 48 percent of the manufacturing jobs in the state of Michigan were lost.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> There are lots of houses available for sale in Detroit <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/15-houses-you-can-buy-in-detroit-for-500-or-less-2013-7">right now</a> for $500 or less.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> At this point, there are approximately <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10190640/Motor-City-Detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-with-100000-creditors.html">78,000 abandoned homes</a> in the city.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> About <a title="one-third" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1370199/Detroit-Haunting-photos-crumbling-remains-highlight-decline-Motor-City.html" target="_blank">one-third</a> of Detroit's 140 square miles is either vacant or derelict.</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> An astounding <a title="47 percent" href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2011/05/04/report-nearly-half-of-detroiters-cant-read/" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of the residents of the city of Detroit are functionally illiterate.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> <a title="Less than half" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/11-charts-that-show-why-detroit-is-falling-apart-and-heading-for-bankruptcy-2013-6#its-hard-to-get-income-tax-revenue-out-of-detroits-poor-populace-less-than-half-of-detroit-residents-over-16-are-working-unemployment-is-186-and-thats-down-from-a-peak-over-27-in-2009-10" target="_blank">Less than half</a> of the residents of Detroit over the age of 16 are working at this point.</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> If you can believe it, <a title="60 percent" href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/01/24/report-childhood-poverty-high-in-detroit-but-teen-pregnancy-down/" target="_blank">60 percent</a> of all children in the city of Detroit are living in poverty.</p>
<p><strong>12)</strong> Detroit was once the fourth-largest city in the United States, but over the past 60 years the population of Detroit has fallen by <a title="63 percent" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/11-charts-that-show-why-detroit-is-falling-apart-and-heading-for-bankruptcy-2013-6#everybodys-leaving-detroit-over-the-last-six-decades-its-jobs-base-has-eroded-and-its-population-has-declined-63-1" target="_blank">63 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13)</strong> The city of Detroit is now very heavily dependent on the tax revenue it pulls in from the casinos in the city.  Right now, Detroit is bringing in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-bankruptcy-casino/index.html?iid=HP_River">about 11 million dollars a month</a> in tax revenue from the casinos.</p>
<p><strong>14)</strong> There are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead">70</a> "Superfund" hazardous waste sites in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>15)</strong> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10190640/Motor-City-Detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-with-100000-creditors.html">40 percent</a> of the street lights do not work.</p>
<p><strong>16)</strong> Only <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10190640/Motor-City-Detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-with-100000-creditors.html">about a third</a> of the ambulances are running.</p>
<p><strong>17)</strong> Some ambulances in the city of Detroit have been used for so long that they have <a title="more than 250,000 miles" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/11-charts-that-show-why-detroit-is-falling-apart-and-heading-for-bankruptcy-2013-6#this-winter-the-city-often-had-just-10-to-14-out-of-its-36-ambulances-in-service-some-have-over-250000-miles-on-them-in-march-a-group-of-corporate-donors-gave-8-million-so-the-city-can-buy-more-ambulances-5" target="_blank">more than 250,000 miles</a> on them.</p>
<p><strong>18)</strong> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead">Two-thirds</a> of the parks in the city of Detroit have been permanently closed down since 2008.</p>
<p><strong>19)</strong> The size of the police force in Detroit has been cut <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead">by about 40 percent</a> over the past decade.</p>
<p><strong>20)</strong> When you call the police in Detroit, it takes them an average of <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100899901/page/2">58 minutes</a> to respond.</p>
<p><strong>21) </strong>Due to budget cutbacks, most police stations in Detroit are now closed to the public <a title="for 16 hours a day" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2082445/Who-gonna-Detroit-police-stations-close-doors-public-16-hours-day.html" target="_blank">for 16 hours a day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>22)</strong> The violent crime rate in Detroit is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead">five times higher</a> than the national average.</p>
<p><strong>23)</strong> The murder rate in Detroit is <a title="11 times higher" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100414480" target="_blank">11 times higher</a> than it is in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>24)</strong> Today, police solve <a title="less than 10 percent" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/11-charts-that-show-why-detroit-is-falling-apart-and-heading-for-bankruptcy-2013-6#-and-detroit-police-mismanaged-and-understaffed-solve-less-than-10-percent-of-crimes-3" target="_blank">less than 10 percent</a> of the crimes that are committed in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>25)</strong> Crime has gotten so bad in Detroit that even the police are telling people to "<a title="enter Detroit at your own risk" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/police-enter-detroit-at-your-own-risk" target="_blank">enter Detroit at your own risk</a>".</p>
<p>It is easy to point fingers and mock Detroit, but the truth is that the rest of America is going down the exact same path that Detroit has gone down.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p>Detroit just got there first.</p>
<p>All over this country, there are hundreds of state and local governments <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100898027">that are also on the verge of financial ruin</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Everyone will say, 'Oh well, it's Detroit. I thought it was already in bankruptcy,' " said Michigan State University economist Eric Scorsone. "But Detroit is not unique. It's the same in Chicago and New York and San Diego and San Jose. It's a lot of major cities in this country. They may not be as extreme as Detroit, but a lot of them face the same problems."</p></blockquote>
<p>A while back, Meredith Whitney <a href="http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/meredith-Whitney-bond-Criticism/2011/01/12/id/382594">was highly criticized</a> for predicting that there would be a huge wave of municipal defaults in this country.  When it didn't happen, the critics let her have it mercilessly.</p>
<p>But Meredith Whitney was not wrong.</p>
<p>She was just early.</p>
<p>Detroit is only just the beginning.  When <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-nightmare-scenario">the next major financial crisis strikes</a>, we are going to see a wave of municipal bankruptcies unlike anything we have ever seen before.</p>
<p>And of course the biggest debt problem of all in this country <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-government-will-borrow-close-to-4-trillion-dollars-this-year">is the U.S. government</a>.  We are going to pay a great price for piling up nearly 17 trillion dollars of debt and over 200 trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities.</p>
<p>All over the nation, our economic infrastructure is being gutted, debt levels are exploding and poverty is spreading.  We are consuming far more wealth than we are producing, and our share of global GDP has been declining dramatically.</p>
<p>We have been living way above our means for so long that we think it is "normal", but an extremely painful "adjustment" is coming and most Americans are not going to know how to handle it.</p>

<p>In fact, the director general of the International Labor Organization is fully convinced that unemployment is going to continue to rise in G20 nations.  Just check out what he told <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100898790?__source=yahoo|finance|headline|headline|story&amp;par=yahoo&amp;doc=100898790|%27Alarming%27%20unemployment%20c">CNBC</a> on Friday...</p>
<blockquote><p>Unemployment will likely soar further in the group of 20 major economic powers without immediate action, Guy Ryder, the director general of the International Labor Organization told CNBC on Friday, comparing the jobs crisis to the 2008-2009 financial crisis and warning it needs to be tackled urgently.</p>
<p>"We have gone backwards. It is quite alarming to see...that unemployment has not gone down, in fact it's gone up," Ryder told CNBC at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Moscow.</p>
<p>He said 93 million people were currently unemployed in the G20.</p></blockquote>
<p>And when those living in G20 nations lose their jobs, they tend to stay out of work for a very long time.  In fact, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100898790?__source=yahoo|finance|headline|headline|story&amp;par=yahoo&amp;doc=100898790|%27Alarming%27%20unemployment%20c">30 percent</a> of unemployed workers in G20 countries have been out of work for one year or longer.</p>
<p>Major industrialized nations all over the planet are no longer able to produce enough jobs for their people.  In many "wealthy nations" the unemployment rate has already risen well up into double digits.  Just consider the following numbers...</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate is <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100898790?__source=yahoo|finance|headline|headline|story&amp;par=yahoo&amp;doc=100898790|%27Alarming%27%20unemployment%20c">above 25 percent</a> in South Africa.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in France recently hit <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Job_market_in_France_suffers_as_unemployment_rate_hits_fifteen_year_high">a 15 year high</a>.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Italy is up to <a title="12.2 percent" href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/italy-unemployment-rises-to-new-record-122-in-may-20130701-00063" target="_blank">12.2 percent</a>, which is the highest in 35 years.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in the eurozone as a whole is up to an all-time high of <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">12.2 percent</a>.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Poland is <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">13.2 percent</a>.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Ireland is now <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">13.6 percent</a>.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Portugal has rocketed up to <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">17.7 percent</a>.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Greece is currently sitting at <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">26.9 percent</a> and it is being projected that it will soon hit 30 percent.</p>
<p>-The unemployment rate in Spain is even worse than in Greece.  The unemployment rate in Spain is a staggering <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/unemployment-rate">27.2 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like things are not going to be getting better any time soon.  In fact, global business confidence is now the lowest that it has been <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/51b7e4ddbd1942cfa6c38fde7029890b">since the last recession</a>.</p>
<p>So what about the United States?</p>
<p>Well, it is true that our official numbers do not look quite as bad as much of the rest of the world.  But the official unemployment rate in the U.S. has been at 7.5 percent or higher for <a title="54 months in a row" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/54-months-record-stretch-75-unemployment-continues" target="_blank">54 months in a row</a>.  That is the longest stretch in U.S. history.</p>
<p>But at least it is not in double digits yet.</p>
<p>Things could be worse.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that we are doing well either.</p>
<p>The mainstream media is attempting to convince us <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/everything-is-fine-but">that everything is just fine</a> because the unemployment rate has been "going down", but when you take a deeper look at the numbers that is not exactly an accurate assessment of our situation.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/labor-force-participation-is-not-coming-back/">the New York Times</a> recently pointed out, the decline in the unemployment rate can almost entirely be accounted for by a decline in the labor participation rate...</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s take a step back. Lots of people lost jobs during the Great Recession. In the aftermath, the great surprise has been how few are looking for new jobs. Labor force participation, the share of adults working or trying to find work, has stagnated at about 63.5 percent, almost three percentage points below the pre-recession level.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate has dropped almost entirely because of this decline in labor force participation. In other words, it has not fallen because people are finding jobs. It has fallen <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/keeping-up-not-getting-ahead/">because fewer people are looking for jobs</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a more accurate picture of what is really happening with employment in America, you need to look at the employment-population ratio.  It is a measurement of the percentage of the working age population that is actually working.  As you can see, the percentage of working age Americans that actually have a job has been declining since the year 2000...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/worldwide-unemployment-crisis-there-are-93-million-unemployed-workers-in-g20-nations/employment-population-ratio-2013-7" rel="attachment wp-att-6115"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6115" alt="Employment-Population Ratio 2013" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Employment-Population-Ratio-20131-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there has been no employment recovery.</p>
<p>When the mainstream media tells you that the employment numbers for June were "great", that is not being honest.  The truth is that the unemployment rate rose <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/19/june-state-unemployment-rates/2567671/">in 28 U.S. states</a> and it only declined <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/19/june-state-unemployment-rates/2567671/">in 11 states</a> during June, and as I mentioned <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/everything-is-fine-but">yesterday</a>, the U.S. economy actually lost <a title="240,000" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/goodbye-full-time-jobs-hello-part-time-jobs-r-i-p-middle-class">240,000</a> full-time jobs last month.</p>
<p>So no, things are not getting better, and the unemployment problems in the United States and in Europe are likely going to continue to get worse in the years ahead.</p>
<p>That is very bad news for most of us, because the only thing that most of us have to offer in the marketplace is our labor.  If the value that is placed on our labor is continually declining, then that puts us in a very difficult position.</p>
<p>It is almost as if we have all been drafted to play a very twisted game of musical chairs.  Each time the music stops, more chairs (jobs) are being pulled out of the game.</p>
<p>You might be doing okay for the moment, but what is going to happen when the music suddenly stops one day and <strong>your chair</strong> gets pulled out of the game?</p>
<p>That is something that you might want to start thinking about.</p>

<p>Sadly, what we are experiencing right now is a "mini-hope bubble" that has been produced by an unprecedented debt binge by the federal government and by unprecedented money printing by the Federal Reserve.  Once this "sugar high" wears off, it will be glaringly apparent that by "kicking the can down the road" Bernanke and Obama have made our long-term problems even worse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most Americans don't understand these things.</p>
<p>Most Americans just let their televisions do their thinking for them, and right now their televisions are telling them that everything is going to be fine.</p>
<p>But is that really the case?</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the city of Detroit has just filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.  It will be <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/18/detroit-files-for-largest-municipal-bankruptcy-in-us-history/">the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Detroit filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history Thursday after steep population and tax base declines sent it tumbling toward insolvency.</p>
<p>The filing by a state-appointed emergency manager means that if the bankruptcy filing is approved, city assets could be liquidated to satisfy demands for payment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a minute, didn't Barack Obama say that he "<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/node/476579">refused to let Detroit go bankrupt</a>" less than a year ago?</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but continuing claims for unemployment benefits just spiked to the highest level <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/print/476545">since early 2009</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the U.S. economy actually <strong>lost</strong> <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/goodbye-full-time-jobs-hello-part-time-jobs-r-i-p-middle-class">240,000</a> full-time jobs last month.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has now reached <a href="http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp">$3.66</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the number of Americans on food stamps has increased <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm">by almost 50 percent</a> while Obama has been in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the U.S. government is going to borrow <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-government-will-borrow-close-to-4-trillion-dollars-this-year">about 4 trillion dollars</a> in fiscal 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but worldwide business confidence has fallen to the lowest level <a href="http://www.moneynews.com/Economy/Markit-business-confidence-optimism/2013/07/16/id/515229?s=al&amp;promo_code=142F2-1">since the last recession</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fine</strong>, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dempsey-comments-on-syrian-war-2013-7">just told Congress</a> that Obama is considering using the U.S. military to intervene in the conflict in Syria.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cold, hard reality of the matter is that everything is <strong>not</strong> fine.</p>
<p>As a nation, we consume far more wealth that we produce.</p>
<p>As a nation, we buy far more stuff from the rest of the world than they buy from us.</p>
<p>As a nation, our debt is growing at a much faster pace than our economy is.</p>
<p>As a nation, our share of global GDP has been dropping like a rock over the past decade.</p>
<p>Our economic infrastructure is being systematically gutted, Wall Street has been transformed into a gigantic casino and poverty in the United States continues to explode even in the midst of this so-called "economic recovery".</p>
<p>How in the world can the mainstream media get away with telling the American people that everything is just fine?</p>
<p>The economic fundamentals are absolutely screaming that massive trouble is on the horizon.  Hopefully people are getting ready, because a whole lot of pain is on the way for this country.</p>

<p>When the government borrows money, it has to pay it back someday.  Back in the old days, the federal government used to issue lots of debt that would not mature for a very long time.  But in recent years <a href="http://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/forecasts_trends/archive/2012/04/03/our-national-debt-is-scarier-than-you-think.aspx">things have been very different</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to fund the government, the Treasury Department periodically auctions Treasury securities with various maturities ranging from 30-day Treasury bills to 30-year Treasury bonds, with 2-3-5-7-year and 10-year Treasury notes in between. It used to be that the bulk of Treasury borrowing was done in the longer-term instruments with maturities of at least 10 years.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, this trend has shifted more toward shorter-term Treasury securities. There are pros and cons to both strategies. Generally speaking, the shorter maturities are considered more risky since short-term interest rates can vary frequently. Shorter-term maturities obviously have to be rolled over much more often. That raises the risk that there might not be enough buyers when the government needs them.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, the average maturity of outstanding government debt is only <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130206-711894.html">65 months</a>, and only about 10 percent of all Treasury debt matures outside of a decade.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that the federal government must constantly roll over massive amounts of debt.  Once again, this is not too much of a problem as long as interest rates stay super low, but as <a href="http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2012/11/debt-maturity.html">John Cochrane</a> pointed out, if rates start rising back to "normal" levels things could get quite hairy very quickly...</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s the nightmare scenario: Suppose that four years from now, interest rates rise 5 percent, i.e. back to normal, and the US has $20 trillion outstanding. Interest costs alone will rise $1 trillion (5% of $20 trillion) – doubling already unsustainable deficits! This is what happened to Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Don’t think it can’t happen to us. It’s even more likely, because fear of inflation – which did not hit them, since they are on the Euro – can hit us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, those running things appears to be quite clueless.  For example, retiring U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann recently asked Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke why the national debt has remained frozen in place for 56 straight days even though we have been borrowing lots of money.  Bernanke seemed to have <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/07/are-you-cooking-the-books/">no idea how to answer that question</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday, Bachmann asked how there could be no increase reported in the total debt when the government is racking up about $4 billion a day in new debt.</p>
<p>“After nearly 10 years as the head of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke could not answer my question today in Financial Services Committee,” Bachmann told WND.</p>
<p>She wondered if there’s a political motive.</p>
<p>“I asked whether the Treasury Department was cooking the federal government’s books as it was reported that the Feds debt balance sheet remained at $16,699,396,000,000 for 56 days straight, presumably so the Treasury Department wouldn’t officially register that once again the Congress had exceeded its legal borrowing limits.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the moment, the federal government is able to recklessly borrow and spend money and investors are rewarding this behavior with super low interest rates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this state of affairs is completely and totally unsustainable.  At some point global financial markets will begin to behave rationally, and when that happens it is going to mean a tremendous amount of pain for the United States.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the U.S. government has added more than 11 trillion dollars to the national debt at a time when the U.S. economy <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade">has been steadily declining</a>.  Anyone that thinks that we can continue to pile up more debt like this indefinitely does not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>The following are <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-statistics-about-the-fall-of-the-u-s-economy-that-are-almost-too-crazy-to-believe">some more statistics</a> about the U.S. national debt for you to consider...</p>
<p>-Back in 1980, the U.S. national debt was <a title="less than one trillion dollars" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm" target="_blank">less than one trillion dollars</a>.  Today, it is rapidly approaching 17 trillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>During Obama's first term, the federal government accumulated more debt than it did under <a title="the first 42 U.S presidents combined" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-obama-increased-debt-50521-household-more-first-42-presidents-53-terms" target="_blank">the first 42 U.S presidents combined</a>.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>The U.S. national debt is now <a title="more than 22 times larger" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm" target="_blank">more than 23 times larger</a> than it was when Jimmy Carter became president.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>If you started paying off <strong>just the new debt</strong> that the U.S. has accumulated during the Obama administration at the rate of one dollar per second, it would take <strong>more than 184,000 years</strong> to pay it off.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>If right this moment you went out and started spending one dollar every single second, it would take you <a title="more than 31,000 years" href="http://defeatthedebt.com/" target="_blank">more than 31,000 years</a> to spend one trillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>If you were alive when Jesus Christ was born and you spent one million dollars every single day since that point, you still would not have spent one trillion dollars by now.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>Some suggest that "taxing the rich" is the answer.  Well, if Bill Gates gave every single penny of his entire fortune to the U.S. government, it would only cover the U.S. budget deficit <a title="for 15 days" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1390090/One-giant-debt-mankind-U-S-national-deficit-reach-moon-piled-high-5-bills.html" target="_blank">for 15 days</a>.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>If the federal government used GAAP accounting standards like publicly traded corporations do, the real federal budget deficit for 2011 would have been <a title="5 trillion dollars" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-real-obama-budget-deficit-for-2011-5-trillion-dollars" target="_blank">5 trillion dollars</a> instead of 1.3 trillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>The United States already has more government debt <a title="per capita" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/sites/all/files/images/-1.img_assist_custom-640x421.png" target="_blank">per capita</a> than Greece, Portugal, Italy, Ireland or Spain does.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>At this point, the United States government is responsible <a title="for more than a third" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lydia-fisher/conquerors-debt-joblessne_b_877700.html" target="_blank">for more than a third</a> of all the government debt in the entire world.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>The amount of U.S. government debt held by foreigners is <a title="about 5 times larger" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FDHBFIN" target="_blank">about 5 times larger</a> than it was just a decade ago.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>The U.S. national debt is now <a title="more than 37 times larger" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm" target="_blank">more than 37 times larger</a> than it was when Richard Nixon took us off the gold standard.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>The U.S. national debt is now more than 5000 times larger than it was when the <a title="Federal Reserve" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> was first created.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff is warning that the U.S. government is facing a gigantic tsunami of unfunded liabilities in the coming years that we are counting on our children and our grandchildren to pay.  Kotlikoff speaks of a "fiscal gap" which he defines as "the present value difference between projected future spending and revenue".  His calculations have led him to the conclusion that the federal government is facing a fiscal gap of <a title="222 trillion dollars" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html" target="_blank">222 trillion dollars</a> in the years ahead.</p>
<p>For the moment everything is fine because interest rates are incredibly low and the mockers in the "deficits don't matter" fan club are having a field day.</p>
<p>But what is going to happen when interest rates return to rational levels?</p>
<p>How will the U.S. government be able to borrow the trillions of dollars that it needs to borrow every single year?</p>
<p>That is why it is so important to watch interest rates.  When they start skyrocketing, big trouble is ahead.</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> According to the World Bank, U.S. GDP accounted for <a title="31.8 percent" href="http://acrossthestreetnet.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/the-cost-of-kidding-yourself/" target="_blank">31.8 percent</a> of all global economic activity in 2001.  That number dropped to <a title="21.6 percent" href="http://acrossthestreetnet.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/the-cost-of-kidding-yourself/" target="_blank">21.6 percent</a> in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> The United States was once ranked #1 in the world in GDP per capita.  Today we have slipped <a title="to #12" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html" target="_blank">to #14</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The United States has fallen in the global economic competitiveness rankings compiled by the World Economic Forum <a title="for four years in a row" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/a-look-behind-the-u-s-decline-in-global-competitiveness/" target="_blank">for four years in a row</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> Since the year 2000, the size of the U.S. national debt has grown <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm">by more than 11 trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Back in the year 2000, our trade deficit with China was <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html">83 billion dollars</a>.  Last year, it was <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html">315 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> In the year 2000, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-amazing-charts-that-demonstrate-the-slow-agonizing-death-of-the-american-worker">about 17 million</a> Americans were employed in manufacturing.  Today, only <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-amazing-charts-that-demonstrate-the-slow-agonizing-death-of-the-american-worker">about 12 million</a> Americans are employed in manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> The United States has lost <a title="more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities" href="http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/" target="_blank">more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities</a> since 2001.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> The United States has lost <a title="a&amp;nbsp;staggering 32 percent" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_plight_of_american_manufacturing" target="_blank">a staggering 32 percent</a> of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Between <a title="December 2000 and December 2010" href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/02/267889/" target="_blank">December 2000 and December 2010</a>, 38 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio were lost, 42 percent of the manufacturing jobs in North Carolina were lost and 48 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Michigan were lost.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Back in 1998, the United States had 25 percent of the world’s high-tech export market and China had just 10 percent. Today, China’s high-tech exports <a title="are more than twice the size" href="http://247wallst.com/2012/01/24/eight-industries-the-u-s-has-lost-to-china/3/" target="_blank">are more than twice the size</a> of U.S. high-tech exports.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> In 2002, the United States had a trade deficit in "advanced technology products" of $16 billion with the rest of the world.  In 2010, that number skyrocketed <a title="to $82 billion" href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=267889" target="_blank">to $82 billion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> The United States has lost <a title="more than a quarter" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-losing-high-tech-manufacturing-jobs-to-asia/2012/01/17/gIQA9P1S6P_story.html" target="_blank">more than a quarter</a> of all of its high-tech manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> The number of full-time workers in the United States is nearly <a title="6 million below" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/LNS12500000.txt" target="_blank">6 million below</a> the old record that was set back in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The average duration of unemployment in the United States is <a title="nearly three times" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UEMPMEAN" target="_blank">nearly three times</a> as long as it was back in the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> Throughout the year 2000, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/EMRATIO.txt">more than 64 percent</a> of all working age Americans had a job.  Today, only <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/EMRATIO.txt">58.7 percent</a> of all working age Americans have a job.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> The official unemployment rate has been at 7.5 percent or higher for <a title="54 months in a row" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/54-months-record-stretch-75-unemployment-continues" target="_blank">54 months in a row</a>.  That is the longest stretch in U.S. history.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> The U.S. government says that the number of Americans "not in the labor force" rose by <a title="17.9 million" href="http://www.theburningplatform.com/?p=28887" target="_blank">17.9 million</a> between 2000 and 2011.  During the entire decade of the 1980s, the number of Americans "not in the labor force" rose by only <a title="1.7 million" href="http://www.theburningplatform.com/?p=28887" target="_blank">1.7 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> The average number of hours worked per employed person per year has fallen <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-amazing-charts-that-demonstrate-the-slow-agonizing-death-of-the-american-worker">by about 100</a> since the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> The U.S. economy continues to trade <a title="good paying jobs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/from-good-jobs-to-bad-jobs-to-no-jobs-the-tragic-downfall-of-the-american-worker" target="_blank">good paying jobs</a> for low paying jobs.  <a title="60 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/economic-failure-58-percent-of-the-jobs-being-created-are-low-paying-jobs" target="_blank">60 percent</a> of the jobs lost during the last recession were mid-wage jobs, but <a title="58 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/economic-failure-58-percent-of-the-jobs-being-created-are-low-paying-jobs" target="_blank">58 percent</a> of the jobs created since then have been low wage jobs.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> The U.S. economy lost <a title="more than 220,000 small businesses" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/26/economy-lost-more-than-200000-small-businesses-in-recession-census-shows/" target="_blank">more than 220,000 small businesses</a> during the recent recession.</p>
<p><strong>#21</strong> The percentage of Americans that are self-employed has <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/they-are-murdering-small-business-the-percentage-of-self-employed-americans-is-at-a-record-low">steadily declined</a> over the past decade and is now at an all-time low.</p>
<p><strong>#22</strong> According <a title="to economist Tim Kane" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/we-are-witnessing-the-death-of-small-business-in-america">to economist Tim Kane</a>, the following is how the number of startup jobs per 1000 Americans breaks down <a title="by presidential administration" href="http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Kane--TheCollapseofStartupsinJobCreation0912web.pdf" target="_blank">by presidential administration</a>...</p>
<p>Bush Sr.: 11.3</p>
<p>Clinton: 11.2</p>
<p>Bush Jr.: 10.8</p>
<p>Obama: 7.8</p>
<p><strong>#23</strong> In the year 2000, there were only <a title="17 million" href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/10/16/decline-of-the-middle-class-behind-the-numbers" target="_blank">17 million</a> Americans on food stamps.  Today, there are more than <a title="47 million" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">47 million</a> Americans on food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>#24</strong> In the year 2000, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages was approximately <a title="21 percent" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41969508" target="_blank">21 percent</a>.  Today, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages is approximately <a title="35 percent" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41969508" target="_blank">35 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#25</strong> Since Barack Obama entered the White House, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States has risen from $1.85 <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/16/news/economy/4-dollar-gas/index.html?iid=HP_River">to $3.64</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#26</strong> More than twice as many new homes were sold in the United States <a title="in 2005" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/HSN1FNSA" target="_blank">in 2005</a> as will be sold in 2013.</p>

<p>The first thing that you will notice about the McDonald's Budget is that it expects workers to have two jobs.  It is an open admission that working at McDonald's is not enough to survive.  So this budget assumes that the worker will take on a second job which will pay nearly as much as the first one does.  Assuming that both jobs pay about the minimum wage, the budget will require about 70 to 80 hours of work every week.</p>
<p>People can put in those kind of hours for a time, but after a while your body starts to break down.  I have been there, and I have known many others that have been there.</p>
<p>But let's assume that the hypothetical worker that this budget is for can work that many hours indefinitely.  The budget assumes a yearly income of about $24,000 after taxes, and that would make it a fairly typical budget for a typical working class American.</p>
<p>In the United States today, <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2011">47 percent</a> of all U.S. workers make less than $25,000 a year <strong>before</strong> taxes.  So millions upon millions of U.S. workers are trying to make ends meet each month on very limited incomes.</p>
<p>Does the "McDonald's Budget" provide any solutions for those workers?</p>
<p>Well, this budget allocates $0 for food, so if you plan on following this budget you might want to anticipate fasting a lot each month.</p>
<p>This budget also allocates $0 for gasoline.  So either you will have to ride a bicycle or walk everywhere you go.</p>
<p>This budget does not allocate any money for clothing either.  If you really need something to wear, perhaps you can take some cash from the "monthly spending money" category and go down to the local thrift store and get something.</p>
<p>In addition, this budget has no money for water, no money for child care and you might as well forget about saving for retirement.  But if you work yourself 70 to 80 hours a week, you probably won't even make it to retirement age anyway.</p>
<p>So what are some of the things that actually are in the budget?</p>
<p>Well, it allocates $20 a month for health insurance.</p>
<p>Wow - where can I sign up for that health insurance plan?</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/16/that-mcdonalds-budget-people-are-making-fun-of-isnt-cruel-its-realistic/?tid=pm_business_pop">the Washington Post</a> noted, nobody is going to be able to get health insurance that cheaply...</p>
<blockquote><p>Low-income individuals receive assistance from Medicaid, but an after-tax income of $24,720 would put Medicaid out of reach in most states. The same point will likely apply to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/23/california-obamacare-premiums-no-rate-shock-here/">subsidies offered</a> by Obamacare: An individual with an income of $17,000 in California will be able to get a basic health insurance plan at no cost, but an individual making $28,000 will have to pay at least $137 per month.</p>
<p>So even a young, healthy person will have to pay $100 or more for an individual health insurance policy in most circumstances. Perhaps McDonalds is tacitly admitting that many low-income workers, including McDonalds employees, can’t afford health insurance and simply make do without it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The original version of the budget also assumed that the worker would spend zero dollars a month on "heating".</p>
<p>Perhaps McDonald's just expects their workers to freeze all winter.</p>
<p>The new version of the budget now allocates $50 a month for heating.  Perhaps that may work for the state of Florida, but anyone that lives in a northern state knows that it takes a whole lot more than that just to heat up your home to a level that is barely livable during the winter.</p>
<p>This budget is absolutely crazy.  But perhaps even more patronizing then the budget itself is the following statement that is made on the website: "You can have almost anything you want as long as you plan ahead and save for it."</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Do they expect anyone to actually fall for that line?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.  Working at McDonald's is great for some people.  I worked there myself when I was in high school.  But the vast majority of adult Americans need jobs that will enable them to take care of their families.  And those kinds of jobs are rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. economy <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/goodbye-full-time-jobs-hello-part-time-jobs-r-i-p-middle-class">lost 240,000 full-time jobs</a>.  We are about 6 million full-time jobs below the all-time record that was set back in 2007.  For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled: "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-decline-of-breadwinner-jobs-has-resulted-in-the-longest-bread-lines-in-american-history">The Decline Of Breadwinner Jobs Has Resulted In The Longest Bread Lines In American History</a>".</p>
<p>Today, one out of every four American workers has a job that pays <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/15-signs-that-the-quality-of-jobs-in-america-is-going-downhill-really-fast">$10 an hour or less</a>.  A lot of very talented people are cutting hair, flipping burgers or working for temp agencies.  Those people should be doing something that takes advantage of their skills and abilities, but the U.S. economy is not producing enough of those kinds of jobs anymore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only just the beginning.  The next major wave of the economic collapse <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-nightmare-scenario">is rapidly approaching</a>, and when it strikes unemployment in this country is going to get much worse.</p>
<p>So don't put all of your faith in the system, because the system is failing.  Even if you do have a good job right now, you could lose it at any moment.</p>
<p>Whatever you can do to become more independent of the system is a good thing.  For example, starting up a side business is a wonderful thing.  It takes a tremendous amount of effort, but nobody can fire you if you are the boss.</p>

<p>In particular, the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries is a very important number to watch.  So much else in our financial system depends on that number as <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/07/16/interest-rates-101-why-the-party-is-over/?iid=HP_River">CNN</a> recently explained...</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, since May, just before Bernanke announced a probable end to QE3, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has jumped around almost one percentage point, to 2.6%, wiping out more than two years of interest payments. The markets clearly fear that far higher long-term rates are lurking in the absence of exceptional policies to rein them in.</p>
<p>That's a crucial issue, because those rates are highly influential in determining the future performance of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Investors grant equities higher multiples when long-term rates are lower; both longer-maturity Treasuries and corporate bonds jump when rates decline; and developers pocket more cash flow from their projects when they borrow cheaply, raising the values of office and apartment buildings. When rates reverse course, so do all of those prices the Fed has been endeavoring to swell as a tonic for the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries has risen substantially, it is still very low.  It has a lot more room to go up.  In fact, as the chart posted below demonstrates, the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries was above 6 percent back in the year 2000...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-nightmare-scenario/10-year-treasury-yield-2" rel="attachment wp-att-6079"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6079" alt="10 Year Treasury Yield" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/10-Year-Treasury-Yield-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>And the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries <strong>should</strong> rise substantially.  It simply <strong>is not rational</strong> to lend the U.S. government money at less than 3 percent when the real rate of inflation is <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/inflation-is-too-low-are-you-kidding-us-bernanke">about 8 percent</a>, the Federal Reserve is rapidly debasing the currency by wildly printing money and the federal government has been piling up debt as if there is no tomorrow...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-nightmare-scenario/national-debt-3" rel="attachment wp-att-6080"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6080" alt="National Debt" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/National-Debt-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>Anyone that lends the U.S. government money at current rates is being very foolish.  You will end up getting back money that has much less purchasing power than you originally invested.</p>
<p>Why would anyone do that?</p>
<p>But if interest rates rise, the U.S. government could be looking at some very hairy interest payments very rapidly.  For example, if the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt just gets back to 6 percent (and it has been far higher than that in the past), the federal government will be shelling out <strong>a trillion dollars a year</strong> just in interest on the national debt.</p>
<p>State and local governments all over the nation could also very rapidly be facing a nightmare scenario.</p>
<p>Detroit is already <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/15/is-detroit-headed-for-bankruptcy/">on the verge</a> of formally declaring the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States, and there are many other state and local governments from coast to coast that are rapidly heading toward financial disaster even though borrowing costs are super low right now.</p>
<p>If interest rates start rising dramatically, it would cause a huge wave of municipal financial disasters, and municipal bond investors <a title="Reuters" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/us-markets-municipals-idUSBRE95J19S20130620" target="_blank">would lose massive amounts of money</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Muni bond investors are in for the shock of their lives," said financial advisor Ric Edelman. "For the past 30 years there hasn't been interest rate risk."</p>
<p>That risk can be extreme. A one-point rise in the interest rate could cut 10 percent of the value of a municipal bond with a longer duration, he said.</p>
<p>Many retail buyers, though, are not ready for the change and "when it starts, it will be too late for them to react," he said, adding that he was encouraging investors to look at their portfolio allocation and make changes to protect themselves from interest rate risks now.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, bond investors of all types could be facing monstrous losses if interest rates go up dramatically.</p>
<p>It is being projected that if U.S. Treasury yields rise by an average of 3 percentage points, it will cause bond investors to lose <a title="a trillion dollars" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100836919" target="_blank">a trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>And already we have started to see a race for the exits in the bond market.  A total of <a title="80 billion dollars" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100855508" target="_blank">80 billion dollars</a> was pulled out of bond funds during the month of June alone.  If you want a visual of the flow of money out of the bond market, just check out the chart <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/07/the-panic-out-of-bonds.html">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>We are witnessing things happen in the financial markets that have not happened in a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And junk bonds will be hit particularly hard.  About a decade ago, the average yield on junk bonds was about twice what it is right now.  When the junk bond crash comes, there is going to be mass carnage on Wall Street.</p>
<p>But of much greater importance to most Americans is what is happening to mortgage rates.  As mortgage rates rise, it becomes much more difficult to sell a house and much more expensive to buy a house.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100876300">CNBC</a>, there is an increasing amount of concern that the rise in mortgage rates that we are witnessing could throw the real estate market into absolute turmoil...</p>
<blockquote><p>The housing recovery is in for a major pause due to higher mortgage rates. It is not in the numbers now, and it won't be for a few months, but it is coming, according to one noted analyst. The market has seen rising rates before, but never so far so fast; there is no precedent for a 45 percent spike in just six weeks. The spike is causing a sense of urgency now, a rush to buy before rates go higher, but that will be short term. Home sales and home prices will both come down if rates don't return to their lows, and the expectation is that they will not.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have seen the number of mortgage applications fall for four weeks in a row, and at this point mortgage applications have declined by <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100876300">28 percent</a> over the past month.</p>
<p>That is an absolutely stunning decline, but it just shows the power of interest rates.</p>
<p>Let's try to put this into real world terms.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30 year rate was sitting at 3.66 percent.  The monthly payment on a 30 year, $300,000 mortgage at that rate would be <strong>$1374.07</strong>.</p>
<p>If the 30 year rate rises to 8 percent, the monthly payment on a 30 year, $300,000 mortgage at that rate would be <strong>$2201.29</strong>.</p>
<p>Does 8 percent sound crazy to you?</p>
<p>It shouldn't.  8 percent was considered to be normal back in the year 2000...</p>
<p><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/a-nightmare-scenario/30-year-mortgage-rate-2" rel="attachment wp-att-6081"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6081" alt="30 Year Mortgage Rate" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/30-Year-Mortgage-Rate-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>This is what we are talking about when we talk about the "bubbles" that the Federal Reserve has created.  The housing market is now completely and totally dependent on these artificially low mortgage rates.  If rates go back to "normal", the results would be absolutely devastating.</p>
<p>But of course the biggest problem with rapidly rising interest rates is the potential for a derivatives crisis.</p>
<p>There are several major U.S. banks that have tens of trillions of dollars of exposure to derivatives.  The following is from one of my previous articles entitled "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-coming-derivatives-panic-that-will-destroy-global-financial-markets">The Coming Derivatives Panic That Will Destroy Global Financial Markets</a>"...</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,812,837,000,000 (just over 1.8 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $69,238,349,000,000 (more than 69 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Citibank</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,347,841,000,000 (a bit more than 1.3 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $52,150,970,000,000 (more than 52 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Bank Of America</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $1,445,093,000,000 (a bit more than 1.4 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $44,405,372,000,000 (more than 44 trillion dollars)</p>
<p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong></p>
<p>Total Assets: $114,693,000,000 (a bit more than 114 billion dollars - yes, you read that correctly)</p>
<p>Total Exposure To Derivatives: $41,580,395,000,000 (more than 41 trillion dollars)</p>
<p>That means that the total exposure that Goldman Sachs has to derivatives contracts is <strong>more than 362 times greater</strong> than their total assets.</p>
<p>The largest chunk of those derivatives contracts is made up of interest rate derivatives.</p>
<p>I have mentioned this so many times before, but it bears repeating that there are <a title="approximately 441 trillion dollars" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-441-trillion-dollar-interest-rate-derivative-timb-bomb">approximately 441 trillion dollars</a> worth of interest rate derivatives sitting out there.</p>
<p>If rapidly rising interest rates suddenly cause trillions of dollars of those bets to start going bad, we could potentially see several of the "too big to fail" banks collapse at the same time.</p>
<p>So what would happen then?</p>
<p>Would the federal government and the Federal Reserve somehow come up with trillions of dollars (or potentially even tens of trillions of dollars) to bail them out?</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has created a giant mess, and when this current low interest rate bubble ends our financial system is going to slam very violently into a very solid brick wall.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://gainspainscapital.com/2013/07/16/theres-a-madman-at-the-wheel-someone-stop-him-before-we-crash/">Graham Summers</a> recently pointed out, entrusting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke with control of our financial system is like putting a madman behind the wheel of a speeding vehicle...</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Imagine if you were in the car with a driver who was going 85 MPH down a road with a speed limit of 35 MPH (this isn’t a bad metaphor as there is absolutely no evidence that QE creates jobs or GDP growth so there is no reason for the Fed to be doing it in the first place).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The guy is obviously out of control. The dangers of driving this fast are myriad (crashing, running someone over, etc.) while the benefits (you <em>might</em> get where you want to go a little faster assuming you don’t crash) are minimal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now imagine that the driver turned to you and said, “I’m thinking about slowing down.” Seems like a great idea doesn’t it? But then a mere two minutes later he says “ we need to continue at 85 MPH for the foreseeable future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At this point any sane person would scream, “STOP.” The driver is clearly a madman and shouldn’t be let anywhere near the driver’s seat. Moreover, he’s totally lost all credibility and isn’t to be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That’s our Fed Chairman.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, most Americans do not understand any of this.</p>
<p>Most Americans have no idea about the immense economic pain that is going to hit us when interest rates go back to normal levels.</p>
<p>All of this could have been avoided, but instead the American people let the central planners over at the Federal Reserve run wild.</p>
<p>When the bubble finally bursts, the official unemployment rate is going to rocket well up into the double digits, millions of families will lose their homes and America will find itself in the middle of the worst economic crisis in modern U.S. history.</p>
<p>Please share this article with as many people as you can.  We need to help people understand what is coming so that they will not be blindsided by it.</p>
