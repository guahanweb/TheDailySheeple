After a disaster occurs, you may not be able to buy food for your family’s survival. That’s one reason why so many activists choose to be prepared with Bug Out Bags, also called 72-hour emergency kits. It’s up to you to do what needs to be done to ensure your self-sufficiency at a time when your government won’t be able to help.<br /><br />Your Bug Out Bag should be checked regularly to ensure that it’s organized and well stocked. All emergency items should be stored in some type of convenient carrier. Many survivalists prefer backpacks. This makes it easy and convenient to quickly grab your short-term emergency kit if you need to evacuate. Not only are these kits perfect for emergency preparedness, they will also come in handy on camp-outs, hiking trips and biking journeys. <br /><br />A 3-day emergency kit could effectively help to save your life after a natural or man-made disaster. No one actually wants a catastrophe to occur. But, as you know, we simply have no control over this. So, the smart thing to do is to be prepared just in case. When tragedy strikes, things tend to get very hectic and chaotic. Your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FoodInsurance">72-hour prepper kit</a> will help give you peace of mind when it comes to your short-term emergency survival.<br /><div><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Easy to Carry Foods for Your 72 Hour Kit</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The goal is to be self-sufficient after a disaster happens. That means having what you need to survive without any type of assistance from your local, state or federal governments. For short-term survival, 72-hour kits are recommended by emergency preparedness experts. This portable kit makes it easy to transport your 3-day supplies during an evacuation. Here are some easy-to-carry, convenient foods for you to pack in your Bug Out Bag:<br /><ul><li>Freeze dried meats</li><li>Turkey or beef jerky</li><li>Pudding cups</li><li>Applesauce cups</li><li>Powdered milk</li><li>Cookies</li><li>Raisin packages</li><li>Fruit rolls</li><li>Fruit cups</li><li>Trail mix</li><li>Suckers</li><li>Juice boxes</li><li>Saltine crackers</li><li>Freeze dried soups</li><li>Bread sticks</li><li>Power bars</li><li>Hard candy</li><li>Hot chocolate mix</li><li>Freeze dried vegetables</li><li>Freeze dried fruits</li></ul><i>Note</i>: The list above is just a reference tool to help you get started on building your 72-hour kit. Every family is different. So, feel free to adjust this list to include your family’s favorite foods as well. Just be sure to address the basic food groups, which you’ll need to consume daily to stay healthy.</div><div><br /><b>Maintaining Your 72-Hour Kit</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Being prepared for any type of man-made, natural or financial disaster could mean the difference between survival and possibly death. Every six months or less, go through your entire 72-hour survival kit. Make sure that all your emergency supplies are in proper working order, and your food storage contains products that are still good for consumption. Cycle all of your regular food storage to keep track of what needs to be eaten now and replaced because of closely approaching “eat by” dates. All of these tips will help you maintain self-sufficiency for three whole days.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>RELATED ARTICLE FROM NATURAL BLAZE:</b></div><div><div><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/05/3-important-reasons-to-have-bug-out-bag.html">3 Important Reasons To Have A 'Bug-Out-Bag', Even If You Aren't A Prepper</a></div><br /><i>This content was written by Chett Wright of Food Insurance, leaders in emergency food storage supplies.

Yet, there are days when efforts of activism from regular citizens is turning Monsanto into an ego-driven malevolent organization that’s easily opposed, undermined and cast out.<br /><br />These days a new global activist movement is emerging where small victories in countries around the world – such as <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/16/monsantos-patent-appeal-rejected-by-indian-government-saving-farmers-food-and-lives/">India</a> and Peru – illustrate the power that we the people have, when united, to stop Monsanto and put an end to the raping of nature and our earth.<br /><br />Europe offers a great example of triumph driven by anti-GMO activism, which could easily fuel the drive of citizens in other countries tired of Monsanto seed overtaking farm lands and of food suppliers selling unlabeled GMO’ed products.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>#1 – Hungary Burns 1000 Acres of Corn to Eradicate GMO Seed</b><br /><div><br /></div><div>Tolerance for GMO in Hungary is slight, at best, exemplified by the burning of about 1000 acres / 500 hectares of corn in mid 2011. The act was conducted not by frustrated activists or enraged protesters, but by agricultural officials and supported by the government. The Ministry of Rural Development had indicated that Monsanto's crops were among corn that was ready for harvesting on the burned plantations, although this was never proved by a third-party organization. Both the farmers and Monsanto denied the claims; but in Hungary, officials have a no tolerance policy. GMO cultivation is a criminal offence. Over the last half decade, the Hungarian government has burned other agricultural fields in an effort to eradicate illegal GM crops. Hungary’s deputy state secretary of the Ministry of Rural Development, Lajos Bognar, <a href="http://blog.ohmygreen.com/blog/?category=GMO">stated</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The government will continue seed distribution as well as crop plantings in the country to ensure that no GMO seeds will slip past authorities.</blockquote>Hungary was one of the first on the European Union to strongly oppose the <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/10/gmos-and-health-the-scientific-basis-for-serious-concern-and-immediate-action/">use of transgenic seeds</a>.<br /><br /><b>#2 – Italy Joins France and Germany in Banning GMO</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Mid July 2013, the Italian agriculture ministry officially banned the cultivation of Monsanto’s MON810 maize, giving the reason of “<a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/02/12/gmo-lie-threatens-life-on-earth-yet-some-resist/">negative impact on biodiversity</a>” as one of the many problems with Monsanto’s GMO crops. The agriculture ministry, backed by the Italian health and environment ministry,&nbsp;<a href="http://planetark.org/wen/69217">stated</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Our agriculture is based on biodiversity, on quality, and those we must continue to aim for, without games that even from an economic point of view would not make us competitive.</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organics.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg" /></a>There was very little GMO cultivation in Italy up to this point, because, frankly, the public opposes transgenic seeds. Italy’s biggest farmers group Coldiretti conducted a survey to assess the public’s opinion regarding GMO crops; the results showed that 80% of Italians are in support of the ban. This is quite uplifting, considering Italy’s culture has a strong culinary foundation and its economy relies heavily on the quality of its food exports.<br /><br />The farming community and activists in Italy have been strongly opposed to GMO seeds for many years, even leading to publicly-condemned actions of vandalism such as stomping and crushing of GMO crops. Twenty-seven conservation, farming and environmental associations, run as the Task Force for an Italy Free of GMOs, have been coordinating efforts against GMO cultivation and putting up legal roadblocks for anyone trying to grow GMO crops. It seems that these activists have won one battle for the sake of the environment and human health.<br /><br /><b>#3 – Monsanto Officially Gives Up on Europe</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Following the GMO defeat in Italy, Monsanto has officially announced that it will withdraw 8 of its 9 patent applications that are pending with the European Commission. A spokesman for the company, Brandon Mitchener, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-monsanto-gmo-crops-europe-20130718,0,1502761.story">stated</a>, “[The patent requests] have been going nowhere fast for several years. There’s no end in sight … due to political obstructionism.” Although the MON810 maize was just banned in Italy, it is currently approved for growing in Europe. Yet this seed was the last of Monsanto’s patented seed that was approved in Europe…in 1998…and the decision of its patent renewal, which expired in 2008, is still not finalized. Regardless of what the European Commission decides about MON810 maize, each country in Europe can make its own assessment of the safety of GMO crops and decides if they want to allow their cultivation on their lands or not.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b></div><div><br /></div><div>In the US it may seem that <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/11/did-us-supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-pave-the-way-for-monsantos-current-reign-over-the-world-food-supply/">Monsanto’s political ties</a> are too strong and advertising budgets too large, for any activist action to make much of a difference. But not for long. People are waking up and they want to know what is in their food supply. Farmers are realizing GMO seeds are not living up to Monsanto’s promises (just watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNxhw2jiDtA#at=126">this video</a>). Environmental groups are realizing the strain that GMO plants are putting on the Earth’s biodiversity. US farmers are starting to realize the freedom they gave up and the power they handed to only a few corporations when it comes to seed (and hence food) ownership. All of this information is quickly spreading through alternative media channels.<br /><br />GMO’ed foods are already being labeled in about 50 countries, and banned in more than 25. Europe – not just one country, but many – is a great example of what unified grassroots organizations, concerned citizens and informed farmers and politicians can do. In addition to the lack of political support of Monsanto’s patenting efforts, the EU does not allow import of GMO food or feed material through its strong GMO labeling laws. So don’t be afraid to participate – to share information – to act. Become part of an activist effort and start making a difference.</div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_UTQa-mCa4/Ue_b8duY9FI/AAAAAAAARVo/c3ovaipyMxo/s1600/seed+collage.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_UTQa-mCa4/Ue_b8duY9FI/AAAAAAAARVo/c3ovaipyMxo/s200/seed+collage.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">44,500 Heirloom Seeds<br />for only 448<br /><b><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/natural-home-products">Click Here</a></b> for details and ordering info.</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><b>Become involved:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/">http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.realfarmacy.com/printable-list-of-monsanto-owned-food-producers/">http://www.realfarmacy.com/printable-list-of-monsanto-owned-food-producers/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://justlabelit.org/">http://justlabelit.org</a><br /><br /><b>Gardening resources:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603425292/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1603425292&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20">Start an organic garden</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865716668/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0865716668&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20">Permaculture basics</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BP4ODKI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00BP4ODKI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20">Starting a new garden</a><br /><br /><b>Sources:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-monsanto-gmo-crops-europe-20130718,0,1502761.story">http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-monsanto-gmo-crops-europe-20130718,0,1502761.story</a><br /><br /><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/italy-ban-monsanto-gmo-corn-mon810-maize-80-percent-public-support">http://naturalsociety.com/italy-ban-monsanto-gmo-corn-mon810-maize-80-percent-public-support</a><br /><br /><a href="http://planetark.org/wen/69217">http://planetark.org/wen/69217</a><br /><br /><a href="http://earthfirstnews.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/italian-anti-gmo-activists-strike/">http://earthfirstnews.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/italian-anti-gmo-activists-strike/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/monsanto-drops-bid-to-advance-new-gm.html">http://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/monsanto-drops-bid-to-advance-new-gm.html</a><br /><br /><a href="http://ecowatch.com/2013/monsanto-stop-promoting-gmo-europe/">http://ecowatch.com/2013/monsanto-stop-promoting-gmo-europe/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://now.msn.com/hungary-burns-1000-acres-of-gmo-corn-crops">http://now.msn.com/hungary-burns-1000-acres-of-gmo-corn-crops</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040525_hungary_gm_corn_burning_fields.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/040525_hungary_gm_corn_burning_fields.html</a><br /><br /><a href="http://blog.ohmygreen.com/blog/?category=GMO">http://blog.ohmygreen.com/blog/?category=GMO</a><br /><br /><i>Alex Pietrowski is an artist and writer concerned with preserving good health and the basic freedom to enjoy a healthy lifestyle.

The babies, vaccinated in Vietnam under the country’s National Expanded Program on Immunization, died on July 20 in the central province of Quang Tri, according to the report. [1]<br /><br />The Vietnamese Health Department has since opted to discontinue the use of two vaccine lots in the entire country to protect other babies from a similar, tragic fate. According to officials, the vaccines were not expired and were properly stored. They were administered by a nurse with over twenty years of experience. [2]<br /><br />On July 21, the nation’s health minister, Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, sent her condolences to the families of the deceased infants, ordering vaccine experts to investigate the tragedy. Preliminary investigations have identified anaphylactic shock as the cause of death. The chairperson of the vaccine program has asked parents to “keep calm” and continue vaccinating their children.<br /><br />Health representatives have conducted damage control with home visits to the grieving parents, paying each family $377 and offering free medical care to the mothers at the hospital where their babies received the deadly vaccinations.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>What Do You Know About Hepatitis B?</b><br /><br />Have you ever asked your child’s doctor about this disease? Do you know any children who have contracted hepatitis B? Are hepatitis B horror stories ever shared among parents at playgroup after everyone has talked about their child’s sleeping-through-the-night issues?<br /><br />You probably don’t know any children who have contracted hepatitis B, because this is a grown-up disease, yet newborns are routinely vaccinated against it at birth.<br /><br />Hepatitis B is a viral infection affecting the liver, and it is only transmitted through direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids. Those at highest risk for contracting hepatitis B are adults between the ages of 20 and 50 who fall into high-risk categories, including men who have sex with men, individuals who have received infected blood through a transfusion, heterosexuals with multiple partners, and healthcare workers who have come into contact with infected blood or body fluids. [3]<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200" /></a>In 2010, there were only 3,374 acute cases of hepatitis B reported in the United States. According to the National Vaccine Information Center’s (NVIC) website, as of March 2012, disturbingly there were over 1500 hepatitis B vaccine-related deaths reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), some of those classified also as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In addition to a high number of deaths, there were a total of 66,654 adverse events reported to VAERS, including but not limited to brain inflammation, convulsions, multiple sclerosis, headaches, irritability, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Guiilain-Barre Syndrome.<br /><br />Even worse, as we know, many adverse events occurring after vaccination are unreported, one of the main limitations of VAERS, as their website states “VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events.” [3]<br /><br /><b>Why are Babies Vaccinated Against Hepatitis B?</b><br /><br />So far in 2013, nine children in the United States have died after receiving the hepatitis B vaccines.  [4]<br /><br />Hepatitis B is a rare childhood disease, yet children are vaccinated for it within twelve hours of birth. Unless their mother is already infected with hepatitis B at the time she gives birth, babies do not fall into any of the risk categories for this disease. [5]<br /><br />The following facts are extremely important and should dissuade every parent from allowing their children to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Mothers can easily be screened in advance to determine if they have this disease. Furthermore, the maximum lifespan of  the hepatitis B vaccine is twenty years, the age at which the newborn may be at risk for contracting hepatitis B, only if they would choose to engage in certain risky behaviors.  [6]<br /><br />Sadly, these newborns are vaccinated at the insistence of public health workers, who have been unable to successfully persuade intravenous drug users and sexually active people with multiple partners to get vaccinated,which translates into a millions of dollars of profit for vaccine manufacturers.<br /><br /><b>Do you need more reasons to refuse this vaccine for your child?</b><br /><br />A member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), Dr. Jane Orient, testified to Congress against the use of hepatitis B vaccines:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">With hepatitis B vaccine, the case for mandatory immunization with few exemptions is far less persuasive than with smallpox or polio vaccines, which protected against highly lethal or disabling, relatively common, and easily transmissible diseases …&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">For most children, the risk of a serious vaccine reaction may be 100 times greater than the risk of hepatitis B. [7]</blockquote>Ironically, despite the fact that 42 percent of US adults at risk for contracting hepatitis B are vaccinated, and a whopping 65 percent of US health care workers have been vaccinated, the incidence of this infection has changed little since the vaccine first became available to high-risk adults in 1998.<br /><br />A study based on six years of data also shows that baby boys who receive the hepatitis B vaccine are three times more likely to develop an autism spectrum disorder. [8]<br /><br />The hepatitis B vaccine has also been shown to cause the death of liver cells and the onset of liver disease.<br /><br />Why are we injecting babies with a genetically engineered vaccine, who are not even in the high-risk category for this disease, when the vaccine is ineffective for the adults who are most at risk?<br /><br /><b>What is in the Hepatitis B Vaccine?</b><br /><br />In the United States, there five versions of the hepatitis B vaccine, three of which are combined with other vaccines. These versions are created through the use of genetic engineering. A segment of the viral gene is inserted into a yeast cell.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8n0lSATEOvA/UHClnvZ78iI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_hdaYp5kbtA/s250/legal-vaccine.jpg" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a>Dozens of ingredients are used to produce these vaccines, including formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, polysorbate 80, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, yeast protein, calf serum, Fenton medium (containing bovine extract), modified Latham medium (derived from bovine casein), modified Stainer-Scholte liquid medium, potassium aluminum sulfate, amorphous aluminum, hydroxyphosphate sulfate, sodium borate, and cells from monkey kidneys. [9]<br /><br />Did you know that newborns are injected with so many chemicals, in a vaccine they don’t even need? Do you think these chemicals belong in their young immune systems?<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />Statistics clearly show this vaccine has been ineffective since its inception, and the number of children who have suffered adverse reactions from the hepatitis B vaccines far surpass the number of deaths from this disease in the United States.<br /><br />The parents of these three Vietnamese babies will mourn the immeasurable loss of their children for the rest of their lives, just like the parents who reported the post-vaccination deaths of nine children in the United States so far this year. They trusted their healthcare providers and their government officials to make sure those vials filled with vaccines were safe.<br /><br />Parents who opt to vaccinate their children also place an implicit, unspoken, and unearned massive amount of trust in the vaccine manufactures to provide “safe vaccines” for their children, a phrase that many of us know is the best example of an oxymoron in the world. There is no such thing as a “safe vaccine,” and vaccinating newborns against an adult disease, one that rarely leaves the confines of its high-risk group, is an ill-informed, foolish decision.  And now, after three babies died at the same hospital after receiving the same vaccine, parents who vaccinate give even more unearned trust in these same officials to remove all of these deadly vaccines from their supply.<br /><br />Payments of a few hundred dollars for the loss of these new lives and lifelong dreams are a sickening insult to parents everywhere. If you are outraged and saddened by this unnecessary infant loss, I urge you to turn your empathy for these parents into action that will help your own child or someone else’s.<br /><br />Share this story with other parents and <a href="http://vactruth.com/2013/07/24/hepatitis-b-vaccine-deaths/:http://vactruth.com/join">sign up now</a> to read the list of vaccine ingredients for yourself, for the safety of your child.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2013/7/105692/">http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2013/7/105692/</a><br /><br />2. <a href="http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2013/7/105702/">http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2013/7/105702/</a><br /><br />3. <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index">https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index</a><br /><br />4.<a href="http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php"> http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php</a><br /><br />5. <a href="http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Hepatitis-B.aspx">http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Hepatitis-B.aspx</a><br /><br />6. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/hepb-vaccine-causes-liver-disease-science-shows-how">http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/hepb-vaccine-causes-liver-disease-science-shows-how</a><br /><br />7. <a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/testimony/hepbcom.htm">http://www.aapsonline.org/testimony/hepbcom.htm</a><br /><br />8. <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/10/08/hepatitis-b-vaccine-triples-the-risk-of-autism-in-infant-boys.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009…</a><br /><br />9. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf</a><br /><br /><i>Missy Fluegge writes for <a href="http://www.vactruth.com/">VacTruth</a> where this article <a href="http://vactruth.com/2013/07/24/hepatitis-b-vaccine-deaths/">first appeared</a>.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/koadmunkee/5528550876/sizes/m/in/photolist-9qxgyG-7bfATD-6ssGVc-4HBT1H-oc8Yx-bkXuPk-6htZN-azYr7w-azYzed-azYzey-azZ1wC-azVZ8k-azZ1xh-azVFP4-azVFNR-azYNof-6fehTk-azYzeG-azZ1wq-azYr9j-5Eogek-azZuxA-azWXRz-azZuxC-aA1YhQ-aA1YhA-aA1Yi3-aA1YhJ-aA1Yij-azWXSB-6fehUg-6Cc8pB-5uTs1G-4Uf8Xy-4Uf993-2b31yB-5b2kTs-5aX6Bn-aHJcTZ-7f2Ygx-6tr1rP-38DUUt-6wBgoc-7sWiqw-cWgd1A-AggpF-rpt6r-ck1Wi5-CiquB-ck26oC-ck1Jiy/">photo credit</a></i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

It is very difficult to make an informed choice about Gardasil or Cervarix when you receive only part of the available information.<br /><br />The time has come to take a critical look at the facts behind recent HPV vaccine news reports.<br /><br />In June 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination with 3 doses of Gardasil for females aged 11 or 12 years and catch-up vaccination for those 13 to 26 years old. In October 2009, this recommendation was updated to include Cervarix as an option for HPV (human papillomavirus) control.<br /><br />The theory behind these two vaccines is: by reducing infections with the two high-risk types of HPV associated with an estimated 70% of cervical cancer cases globally, there may be a reduction in the number of cervical cancer victims. However, until such time as a verifiable reduction in the number of cervical cancer diagnoses is reported, this theory remains unproven.<br /><br /><b>HPV vaccines show striking results?</b><br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>On June 19, 2013, the ACIP held a meeting via teleconference to discuss future HPV vaccination recommendations.  During this teleconference Dr. Lauri Markowitz, CDC Division of STD Prevention, made a startling announcement. According to <a href="http://oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/jid/prpaper.pdf">her research paper</a>: (1)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Among females aged 14-19 years, the vaccine-type HPV prevalence (HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18) decreased from 11.5% in 2003-2006 to 5.1% in 2007-2010, a decline of 56%.</blockquote>One has to wonder why a paper revealing such incredible findings was accepted for publication on April 3, 2013 but embargoed until the day of Dr. Markowitz’s grand announcement. This embargo did not seem to effect the speed at which the ‘news’ got out.<br /><br />Almost the second the embargo was lifted the public was bombarded with articles singing the praises of the latest medical miracle – HPV vaccines. Virtually none of these articles cited or referenced the relevant publication. Those that did only provided access to the abstract.<br /><br />Because of this oversight, neither medical professionals nor medical consumers are able to analyze the study for themselves and verify the glowing ‘facts’ reported in virtually every ‘news’ source across the country.<br /><br />Any article published without providing a way to check facts and verify data is nothing more than free advertising for HPV vaccine manufacturers. Is this the purpose of the Press?<br /><br /><b>Take a look at the study behind the glowing news reports</b><br /><br />In order to evaluate the quality of information in any scientific study, one must understand how the information was gathered, how large the sample size was, and whether the data presented is relevant to the study objective(s).<br /><br />Information for the study conducted by Markowitz et al was taken from the NHANES database. Most people are completely unfamiliar with this source.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MkKSFqq5-DE/TfAbRwTtoXI/AAAAAAAAJRE/itK2KofpgVU/VACCINE-BANNER.gif" /></a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm">NHANES</a> is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Information for this database is collected via personal interviews with specially selected individuals who are intended to be representative of large portions of the population. Each individual’s information is estimated to represent between 50,000 and 65,000 people.(2,3) Answers provided by the participants are not vetted for accuracy by examination of medical records. Information obtained on juveniles is not available to the general public, only CDC approved research scientists can gain access to it, and then only for approved research projects.<br /><br />The interview is followed by a physical examination in a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/features/nhanes_mec_collects_health_data.htm">Mobile Examination Center</a> (MEC).(4) Of particular importance is the fact that HPV prevalence is determined via self-collected vaginal swab samples, then analyzed for HPV DNA using Digene Hybrid Capture and/or Roche Linear Array.(5)<br /><br />CDC officials know, or should know, that the presence of HPV DNA in the vagina has little or nothing to do with the possibility of developing cervical cancer at a later date. CDC officials know, or should know, that it is virtually impossible for a woman to take an adequate cervical specimen themselves. In fact, the CDC site specifically states:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">While HC2 is approved for clinical testing, the self-collected vaginal sample does not meet clinical guidelines. The HPV PCR tests are research tests.”(6)</blockquote><b>For the average medical consumer this brings up the following questions:</b><br /><ul><li>Self-collected samples are not adequate for clinical use. Why are they adequate for research?</li><li>HC2 (Hybrid Capture 2) is approved for use in doctor’s offices – but its accuracy is questionable. When 199 specimens were analyzed by three different laboratories using the same test, agreement on positive results varied from 54-78%.5 Is this percentage of accuracy adequate for your healthcare needs?</li><li>HPV PCR (Roche Linear Array) is not approved for use by your doctor. Accuracy of this test is also questionable. When DNA sequencing was compared to the results of 102 linear array tests, 61% of the results did not match.6 Can you trust medical research based on 39% accuracy?</li></ul>With these limitations in mind, let’s take a look at a few recent headlines touting the ‘phenomenal success’ of HPV vaccines.<br /><br /><b>Headlines versus Facts</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/PublicHealth/39973?isalert=1&amp;uun=g328558d128R5322585u&amp;utm_source=breaking-news&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=breaking-news&amp;xid=NL_breakingnews_2013-06-19"><i><b>Big Drop in HPV, Vaccine Gets Credit</b></i></a>, by Charles Bankhead, Staff Writer, MedPage Today, June 19, 2013, stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Compared with the 4 years prior to the vaccine’s introduction, infection with the HPV strains covered by the vaccine decreased by 56% in 14- to 19-year-old girls in the first 4 years after the vaccine became available.”</blockquote><i>Facts</i>: The article fails to mention that the vaccine-relevant HPV types being measured are based on estimates. NHANES data for 2003-2006 only broke HPV types down into low-risk versus high-risk types. There was no analysis of vaccine-relevant types of HPV versus other types in the 2003-2006 NHANES reports. This makes the study’s baseline prevalence data nothing more than an educated guess.<br /><br />It also fails to mention the study contained only 111 subjects vaccinated against HPV. A person was considered ‘vaccinated’ if they had one or more injections. The CDC recommendation for HPV vaccines is three doses. According to the study, only 62.5% of those who reported HPV vaccinations received all three doses. This would mean there were only 69 fully vaccinated subjects included in the entire study population, approximately 19% of the 2007-2010 group. Is this a sample size large enough to draw conclusions from?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/health/study-finds-sharp-drop-in-hpv-infections-in-girls.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"><i><b>HPV Vaccine Is Credited in Fall of Teenagers’ Infection Rate</b></i></a>, by Sabrina Tavernise, The New York Times, June 19, 2013, stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Yet even with relatively low vaccination rates in the United States, infection with the viral strains that cause cancer dropped to 3.6 percent among girls ages 14 to 19 in 2010, from 7.2 percent in 2006, the officials said.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The infection rate for girls fell even further when the two strains of the virus that cause genital warts were included, with a 56 percent drop over the period of the study.</blockquote><i>Facts</i>: This information is from table 1 of the study, comparing all of the subjects (ages 14-19) who were interviewed whether they reported being sexually active or not. This included 1363 girls in the 2003-2006 group and 740 girls in the 2007-2010 group.<br /><br />Table 3 from the same study is a little more revealing. In this table, all of those who were not sexually active were eliminated. 46% were eliminated from the 2003-2006 group; 52% from the 2007-2010 group. Those who are not sexually active are much less likely to be exposed to HPV. This disparity alone could account for some of the decline in HPV prevalence.<br /><br />Look at the data below from Table 3 of the study, where those who were not sexually active were excluded. Note: those who were not vaccinated experienced a larger decrease in HPV prevalence than those who were vaccinated in all but one category. So, why does the vaccine get the credit?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Table 3: HPV Prevalence Among Sexually Active Females Aged 14-19 Years, Overall and by Vaccination History</b></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxuV6OFEGq4/Ue8fIx7k1JI/AAAAAAAARUY/nFRHqeD3iCk/s1600/2013-07-23_1825.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxuV6OFEGq4/Ue8fIx7k1JI/AAAAAAAARUY/nFRHqeD3iCk/s400/2013-07-23_1825.png" width="256" /></a></div><br />It is interesting to note there is some evidence indicating potential type replacement demonstrated by the increased prevalence of high-risk HPV types which are not vaccine-relevant in those who were vaccinated. These high-risk types include alpha-7 and alpha-9 species. Vaccinated subjects experienced an increase in all three of the high-risk categories.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/19/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rates-down-56/2438137/"><i><b>HPV vaccine reduces cancer virus in girls by 56%</b></i>,</a> by Elizabeth Weise, USA Today, June 19, 2013 states:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Doctors aren’t sure why the decline is so great, given that only 46% of young women have received at least one dose and only 32% have received all three. It could be what’s called herd immunity, in which the vaccinated women lower the overall amount of the virus in the population, thus lowering infection rates for everyone, said Lauri Markowitz, lead author of the study.</blockquote><i>Facts</i>: First, medical professionals and consumers need to understand that the quote above is referencing two different sources of data. The HPV vaccine uptake rates are from a document produced by the CDC entitled, “National and state vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13 through 17-United States, 2010.” (MMWR 2011;60:1117-23). This document has nothing to do with the HPV vaccine uptake rate in those included in the NHANES data.<br /><br />Among those counted in the NHANES data, the uptake rate for HPV vaccine uptake rate was only 34% receiving one or more doses. Those who were fully vaccinated represented only 19% of the age group in question.<br /><br />With all due respect to author Elizabeth Weise, you cannot compare apples to oranges and make any sort of valid scientific conclusion.<br /><br />According to <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitnflash_wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Lecture_1.2.pdf">Vaccines and Public Health</a>, the CDC and WHO have estimated what vaccine coverage needed in order to confer ‘herd immunity’ for the following diseases:<br /><ul><li>Diphtheria – 85%</li><li>Pertussis – 92-94%</li><li>Polio – 80-86%</li><li>Measles – 83-94%</li><li>Mumps – 75-86%</li><li>Rubella – 83-85%</li></ul>How can a representative of the CDC, or anyone else for that matter, even infer that a vaccine uptake between 19-34% would confer any sort of ‘herd immunity?’<br /><br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hpv-vaccine-infection-rate-cancer-20130619,0,5126210.story"><i><b>It works: HPV vaccine reduces infections by 56%, CDC says</b></i></a>, by Karen Kaplan, the Los Angeles Times, June 19 2013 states:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Altogether, a total of 8,403 teens were tested for the four types of HPV — HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16 and HPV-18 — that are targeted by the vaccines. The 56% drop in HPV infection was found for females between the ages of 14 and 19.</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a><i>Facts</i>: 8,403 people were included in the complete study – from 2003-2010 – ages from 14 to 59. Nearly half of those were not tested for type-specific vaccine-relevant HPV, the 4150 subjects from 2003-2006. The other 4253, from the 2007-2010 surveys, only included 740 teens.<br /><br />There is evidence that a reduction in HPV infections did occur. Whether or not it had anything to do with HPV vaccines remains to be seen.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0619-hpv-vaccinations.html"><i><b>New study shows HPV vaccine helping lower HPV infection rates in teen girls</b></i>,</a> by Division of News &amp; Electronic Media, Office of Communications, CDC press release quotes Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC Director, as saying:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">This report shows that HPV vaccine works well, and the report should be a wake-up call to our nation to protect the next generation by increasing HPV vaccination rates,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H.  “Unfortunately only one third of girls aged 13-17 have been fully vaccinated with HPV vaccine.  Countries such as Rwanda have vaccinated more than 80 percent of their teen girls. Our low vaccination rates represent 50,000 preventable tragedies – 50,000 girls alive today will develop cervical cancer over their lifetime that would have been prevented if we reach 80 percent vaccination rates.  For every year we delay in doing so, another 4,400 girls will develop cervical cancer in their lifetimes.</blockquote><i>Facts</i>: This report shows nothing of the sort. This report raises more questions than answers.<br /><br />Respectfully, Dr. Frieden: the 50,000 preventable tragedies you speak of would never occur if women would go for their pap tests as recommended. Pap tests detect cervical cell changes BEFORE cancer begins to develop.<br /><br />You mention Rwanda’s better than 80% uptake on HPV vaccines, but make no mention of any demonstrated reduction in the prevalence of vaccine-relevant HPV in that country. If the United States’ HPV ‘study’ you reference is accurate, Rwanda should have already eliminated nearly all vaccine-relevant HPV. Assuming this is true, it will still take another decade or two to determine if there is any impact on cervical cancer attributable to HPV vaccination programs.<br /><br />Should all high-risk types of HPV be completely eliminated, that would simply mean one risk factor for cervical cancer would no longer be a part of the cervical cancer equation. The remaining risk factors would still be present.<br /><br />Eliminating one risk factor does not justify the adverse events being experienced after HPV vaccines.<br /><br />In the interest of public health and safety, the very least the CDC should do is be honest about the potential risks and refrain from exaggerating the potential benefits of HPV vaccines.<br /><br /><b>References</b>:<br /><br />1)   <a href="http://oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/jid/prpaper.pdf">Reduction in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence Among Young Women Following HPV Vaccine Introduction in the United States, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 2003-2010</a>, JID, Laurie E.

A very common excuse that some people give as to why they cannot prep is their current location. People say, “Well, once we are able to get moved to our farm in two years I’ll start prepping hardcore.” Another favorite is “I’m saving the money for moving instead of using it for preps.” Or even worse, ”Oh, there is no point in prepping here, because if the SHTF I’ll be dead.”<br /><br /><b>Stop this kind of thinking RIGHT NOW!!!!!!</b><br /><br />Sometimes, to borrow an old saying, you just have to bloom where you’re planted.<br /><br />There are many things you can do to increase your preparedness wherever you happen to live. Apartment dwellers at the top of a city high rise, folks in the middle of the desert, and people in HOA-ruled suburban lots all have to examine their situations, figure out their pros and cons, and work towards resolving what they can. With some pre-planning, there is a lot you can overcome if you have the right mindset. I suspect there are just as many (and probably far more) preppers living in the ‘burbs than there are living in perfect rural locations, with a lake, 10 acres of cultivated farmland in an off-grid house.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Money is tight all over. It’s very easy for people to say, off-the-cuff, “Oh, you should move.”<br /><br />But just picking up and moving isn’t that easy. It took me nearly 4 years to be able to do that. People have obligations and ties that some Joe-Blow on the Internet shouting out advice can’t even begin to understand. Some in the prepping community have a complete disconnect with the realities of everyday people. There are reasons like:<br /><ul><li>Not enough money to leave</li><li>A good job (very hard to come by these days)</li><li>Family members in the area that you don’t want to abandon</li><li>No work opportunities where you want to go</li><li>Custody orders that require you to remain in a certain area</li><li>A spouse who is not on board</li><li>A house that won’t sell or with an upside-down mortgage</li></ul><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/foodcrisis.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--tmbBUS3P3Y/TtEcIJ043TI/AAAAAAAAM2w/LDljRbDTITE/s271/foodcrsisi160.gif" /></a>The list goes on and on. There are as many reasons to remain in one place as there are people living in cities. And yes, I could sit here and refute each and every reason a person has chosen to remain, but it wouldn’t do one bit of good. People are sometimes alienated by the prepping movement when it seems that everything is black and white or like their personal decisions are somehow less valid than the decisions of some random person on the Internet.<br /><br />That’s why it’s important to take your current situation, warts and all, and work with it. This doesn’t mean that you should abandon your plans for a better location some time in the future if such a move is warranted. But it means that you shouldn’t put off important preparedness steps until after that move is made.<br /><br /><b>Assess Your Situation</b><br /><br />You don’t know where to go if you don’t know where you are. The first and most vital step is an honest assessment of your current situation. The situation that you have right now, this very minute, not the one you will have in a month or in a year.<br /><br />Prepping is all about pre-planning and knowing what you need in order to thrive.<br /><br />Assess your needs regarding the following in a SHTF scenario or disaster:<br /><ul><li>Water</li><li>Sanitation</li><li>Food/Cooking</li><li>Heating</li><li>Security</li><li>Light</li></ul>Once you know exactly where you are with these things, you can begin to look for solutions that will work for you, today. Dig in and make a plan for the survival of your family.<br /><br />And a little note to those who say, “It doesn’t matter, I’m in downtown Manhattan. I’ll die anyway.”<br /><br />No, you won’t. You won’t be that lucky. You will be absolutely thoroughly miserable, breathing foul unhealthy air. You’ll be thirsty enough to drink unsanitary water, which will cause bowel issues to worsen problem #1. You’ll be hungry, but not hungry enough that you die of starvation. You will be at the mercy of thugs better armed than you. And you won’t die, not right away. You will live like I just described, and it will be horrible. Look at the residents of Manhattan during Hurricane Sandy. They didn’t die but they were absolutely miserable, they were terrified, they were eating from dumpsters, and much of it could have been avoided with some basic preparedness.<br /><br /><b>Survival in a Population Dense Area</b><br /><br />Before I relocated to my little cabin in the woods I lived in a very metropolitan area. I was lucky in that I had 1/10th of an acre. I did everything I could come up with to make my little house as sustainable as possible should the poop hit the oscillating device before I could get out. A disaster in the city IS survivable.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/survivalskills.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" height="250" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lqXulBIIz0E/UHDFeY_hzKI/AAAAAAAAAKc/xxkDPE6OIow/BookTopSeller.gif" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a>I planted every inch of the back yard and grew enough food that the home-canned and frozen produce lasted until Christmas. I stockpiled groceries. I had plywood cut and pre-drilled to cover each window of the house. I had printed official looking quarantine signs to hang on the door of my house as a deterrent. I put together a little outdoor fireplace in the backyard behind my fence. I got a big dog. I collected rainwater from downspouts at each corner of the house. I purchased an antique oil heater in good working order, and stockpiled heating oil. I had enough seeds to plant for the next 4 years. I located nearby sources of water, wood, and nuts. I got a wagon for hauling stuff if the transportation system was down.<br /><br />In short, I did everything possible to make the best of a potentially terrible location. It wasn’t perfect, but we would have outlasted most of the other people in our residential neighborhood and done so under the radar.<br /><br /><b>The Priorities</b><br /><br />Let’s take a look at each of the major challenges that we face in a SHTF situation. Obviously different disasters offer different challenges. These lists aren’t meant to be comprehensive. They are meant to be a starting point to get your wheels turning on how you and your family can best survive, exactly where you’re planted right now.<br /><br /><i>Water</i><br /><br />You can only survive for 3 days without water (and you’ll be weak and suffering way before that) so that should put water preparedness at the very top of your list. Some ideas: 1 month supply of drinking water stored (plan on a gallon per day, per person and pet), non-electric water filtration system (with spare filters), buckets along with a sled or wheel barrow depending on the season for transporting water, a water catchment system, water purification supplies (bleach, pool shock, tablets), system for catching gray water to be reused for flushing, washing, etc.<br /><br /><i>Sanitation</i><br /><br />In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York, it was reported that people were defecating and urinating in the hallways of apartment buildings once the sewer system stopped working. Lack of sanitation is not only unpleasant, but it spreads disease. Some ideas: portapotty, buckets lined with heavy duty trash bags, kitty litter, water for flushing if you have septic, learn how to shut off the main valve so that city sewage cannot back up into your house or apartment, supplies to build an outhouse, lime, baby wipes,antibacterial wipes, white vinegar, bleach, hand sanitizer, extra toilet paper.<br /><br /><i>Food/Cooking</i><br /><br />Most preppers have a food supply, but have you considered how you’re going to prepare all those beans if your stove doesn’t work? Some ideas: Minimum of 1 month of food for each family member and pet; alternative cooking methods indoors like a fondue pot, a woodstove, propane stove, or fireplace; outdoor cooking methods like a barbecue (beware of tantalizing smells and hungry neighbors), outdoor fireplace or firepit, rocket stove, or sun oven; and foods that don’t require cooking or heating.<br /><br /><i>Heating</i><br /><br />This depends upon your climate and the time of year that disaster strikes. Prioritize accordingly. Some ideas: wood stove, fireplace, oil heater, kerosene heater, propane heater, coal heater; non-tech ideas like arctic sleeping bags, winter clothes and accessories, covers for windows, segregating one room to heat.<br /><br /><i>Security</i><br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/urbansurvival.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TWqRdulgBvI/AAAAAAAAHKw/aLTr9hydqj4/urbansurvivalsquare.gif" /></a>In a disaster situation, the risk of potentially violent civil unrest always goes up. We used a two-fold approach of trying to avoid conflict by keeping a low profile, but being ready to deal with it if it couldn’t be avoided. Some ideas: personal defense items (this will vary depending on your location, the laws there, and whether or not you intend to follow those laws), secure heavy doors with reinforced frames, plywood or gridwork to cover the windows, keeping lights off or low, thorny plants around the perimeter of your house and yard, hardening access points, a big dog, an alarm system, and visual deterrents such as warning signs and quarantine signs.<br /><br /><i>Light</i><br /><br />Don’t underestimate the value of light in a dark world. Most city dwellers don’t consider exactly how dark the night can be without streetlights and lights from houses. Emotionally, having a bit of light can help soothe frazzled children (or adults) and help the night seem a little less scary. Use caution that your light cannot be seen from the outside – like moths to a flame, people will be drawn to the only brightly lit house on the street. Some ideas: Solar garden lights, candles, kerosene lights, oil lights, flashlights, headlamps, battery operated LED lights, solar camping lanterns.<br /><br /><b>Make a Plan</b><br /><br />So, if you’re reading this and you’ve been putting off preparedness due to your location, what’s your plan?<br /><br />If you’ve been feeling disheartened by all the folks grimly telling you that your home is a death trap, what can you do over the weekend to improve your chances, right where you are?<br /><br />And if you are fortunate enough to be in an ideal location, please share your ideas about overcoming some of these difficulties in a less than perfect place on the map. As a community, we can all help one another solve problems that could otherwise seem insurmountable.<br /><br /><i>Daisy Luther is a freelance writer and editor.

All three catastrophes stem from the same kind of mistake made by human science and corporate greed. What are they and what are we doing wrong?<br /><br />The slow-motion catastrophes are:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/infection-antibiotic-resistant">antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria</a> – often termed 'superbugs'</li><li>pesticide-resistant pests – also called 'superbugs'</li><li>herbicide-resistant weeds – now termed 'superweeds'</li></ul><b>What do these three have in common?</b><br /><br />All three are the result of the application of synthetic toxicity within nature in an attempt to work outside nature's normal processes. The application of toxins meant to inhibit certain organisms produces resistance, because living organisms by nature seek to survive, and will adapt to toxicity in order to continue their survival.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>This ability to adapt has been studied for many years by scientists and is well known among biology and evolution science. It is one of the foundations of biology taught at the most fundamental levels of instruction for any beginning scientist.<br /><br />Yet the scientific community has failed to understand how this most fundamental part of nature will interact with the toxicity that we have introduced over the past century. Did the scientists who developed these synthetic toxins really believe those toxins would provide a permanent solution?<br /><br />We obviously ignored this most fundamental understanding that living organisms will adapt to toxins. We forgot that organisms will develop defense mechanisms that will override deterrent toxins - producing a stronger organism in the process.<br /><br />Let's examine this aspect in all three cases:<br /><div><br /><b>Antibiotics Produce Plasmid changes</b><br /><br />Antibiotics – or antibacterials – exist in nature, but modern synthetic (static) antibiotics began their development in the nineteenth century among early microbiologists who discovered ways to combat disease by inhibiting bacteria with either antiseptic chemicals or infused antibiotics derived from other microorganisms. Their discoveries led to major advancements in knowledge regarding how to kill bacteria. For example, the Italian Vincenzo Tiberio discovered that the Penicillium mold would remove bacteria from well water.<br /><br />These of course were noble causes and their discoveries have resulted in millions of lives saved from various infections. But is there a long-term cost of waging war against bacteria outside of nature's means - using static toxins?<br /><br />Later scientists found that bacteria will produce what is called a plasmid – a term suggested by Joshua Lederberg in the early 1950s. A plasmid is a collection of genetic material passed on during procreation and even peer-exchange that teaches a bacteria how to resist that particular antibacterial. Even a single bacterium may develop a plasmid change and then pass that plasmid change on to others – both within and outside their species. This passing on of plasmid changes allows bacteria to teach others how to resist that particular toxic agent.<br /><br />We might compare this to warfare among humans. Once we began fighting with swords, the opponents developed shields. After humanity created missiles, the opposition developed anti-missile weapons. After we created nuclear bombs we created nuclear defense mechanisms and bomb shelters.<br /><br />Bacteria are no different. They are also living organisms who want to survive, so they can learn how to evade an antibacterial agent.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organics.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg" /></a>The only problem is that as this escalation continues, those who position themselves as enemies will now be dealing with a stronger organism. This is the case of antibiotic-resistant species of bacteria such as MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and numerous species that cause HAIs – hospital acquired infections.<br /><br />The same exact premise is taking place among weeds. Since 2000 the increasing application of glyphosate has produced a growing legion of superweed horseweeds and other types of herbicide-resistant weeds.</div><div><br /><b>The Growth of Superweeds from Herbicides and GMOs</b><br /><br />In a recent paper by Food &amp; Water Watch, the dramatic rise in the application of herbicides in the U.S. over the last 10 years has led to a growing legion of superweeds. In the 2013 report, called <i>Superweeds: How Biotech Crops Bolster the Pesticide Industry</i>, found that the dramatic rise in the application of herbicides such as glyphosate between 2001 and 2010 has led to an explosion of growth of herbicide-resistant weeds.<br /><br />From 2001 to 2010, toxic herbicide application grew by 81 million pounds – 26 percent. But the application of glyphosate to the three biggest genetically engineered crops skyrocketed from 15 million pounds in 1996 to 150 million pounds in 2012 – this is a ten-fold rise in the application of glyphosate.<br /><br />Prior to the domination of glyphosate and genetically modified "RoundUp Ready" seeds, atrazine was the leading herbicide used. Both atrazine and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/glyphosate">glyphosate</a> have been linked to endocrine disruption, and atrazine has been the subject of study by university researchers for its causing mutations among frogs and fish.<br /><br />As a result of the growth of GMO herbicide-friendly seeds, glyphosate-resistant weeds have been reported in 21 states – up from zero states reporting prior to 2000. The resistant weeds began in the South and spread to other states. By 2012, 92% of Georgia farmers reported glyphosate-resistant weeds, and states throughout the midwest were being swamped by them.<br /><br />These resistant weeds include ragweed, amaranth, horseweed, bluegrass and waterhemp. Ragweed of course is also a common hayfever allergen – and hayfever is also on the rise in the U.S.<br /><br /></div><div><b>SuperPest Growth from Increasing Pesticide Use</b><br /><br />A similar problem is appearing as a result of the growing application of pesticides onto genetically modified crops. Research from the University of Minnesota found that the corn rootworm is developing a resistance to GMO corn and the pesticides applied to it such as Bt and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/dows-deadly-harvest-return-agent-orange">2,4-D</a>. A recent interview with agronomist Todd Claussen from the Brownfield publication indicates that Iowa farmers are dealing with 40 to 50 times the rootworm infection considered normal – and he attributes this to resistance to soil insecticides.<br /><br />What do these mistakes have in common? All three were produced by scientists forgetting the fundamental biology lesson that every living organism strives to survive and thus will adapt and develop resistance to toxins that attempt to interrupt that survival.<br /><br />And the consequences of these adaptations mirror the attempts to inhibit them. In the case of the application of static antibiotics, we are running out of them as bacteria become resistant. In the case of the application of toxic chemicals onto pests and weeds, those pests and weeds are becoming resistant to those toxic chemicals.<br /><br />There are two backlashes to these developments. The first is that we have to increase the application of these toxins in order to get similar results. This means that we become exposed to more toxins - as illustrated in all three instances: The rise in antibiotic use, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/pesticides">pesticide</a> use and herbicide use.<br /><br />The second backlash is that as these living organisms adapt they become stronger. This means it becomes more difficult to inhibit them by any means. (Rendering the adage: "I've created a monster!")<br /><br />Both of these consequences ruins it for other living organisms – including humans – which become threatened by a combination of those stronger living organisms and the increased exposure to toxins.</div><div><br /><b>Is there a Solution to our Toxic Science?</b><br /><br />The solution is to work within nature's means. This means finding those strategies that naturally inhibit those pathogenic organisms. In the case of weeds and pests, crop rotation and the feeding of organic biomass into the soil. This will enrich the soil and help strengthen the plants' own immunity against pests – can help resist pests, along with the utilization of natural predators that already exist in nature. Naturally enriching the soil will also give rise to natural stewards of plants such as earthworms – which help combat other pests and help nourish plants with their own waste production as they convert natural fertilizers.<br /><br />In addition to these, there are numerous natural substances that repel pests, including castor oil, extracts of mint, basil, garlic and other natural means that utilize evolution to repel pests.<br /><br />In the case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the solution lies in employing those natural agents – inclusive of many different antibacterial herbs – that inhibit the growth of bacteria. Another important tool are those probiotic bacteria that are already living within our bodies and can produce their own antibiotics that fight off pathogenic bacteria – as well as fungi and viruses.<br /><br />The other means to protect ourselves naturally comes in the form of increasing our own natural immunity. The comes by way of a better diet, plenty of exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general.<br /><br />The bottom line is that scientists and humanity in general must become better skilled in observation. This means observing nature and its consequences.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text/Image */ google_ad_slot = "1104481866"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>What modern science - increasingly driven by corporate profit objectives - has overlooked is that by working within nature we employ those very tools that have been developed by the same evolution that has developed the creatures that threaten our survival.

Not only do they often aesthetically look wonderful, they also play a big role in improving the air quality within the space. At their core almost every plant will assist in the removal of carbon dioxide and the creation of oxygen, however several plants even go above and beyond this ‘normal’ call of duty.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Here are 5 of the many plants that are great to pot and let grow in your household. Feel free to add any other suggestions you may know through the comment section of the article as well.<br /><br /><b>Bamboo Palm</b><br /><div><br /></div><div>Normally never growing larger than 10 feet tall, the Bamboo Palm is an easy addition to almost any interior space. As a plant it is recognized as one of the best at filtering out benzene and trichloroethylene, both of which can regularly creep into living spaces. The bamboo palm is also great next to pieces of furniture that may be prone to off-gassing formaldehyde, another toxin it can naturally handle pretty well.<br /><div><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Peace Lily</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The perfect fit for any laundry or bathroom, the peace lily specializes in the removal of mold spores. The plant itself does not require large amounts of water or sunlight to survive and even features often beautiful flowers that make it a decorative piece. In addition to mold, the plant is also known to remove formaldehyde and trichloroethylene.</div><div><br /><b>Chinese Evergreen</b></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>What truly makes the Chinese Evergreen cool is the development of its effectiveness. The more time the plant spends in a space, the more effective it becomes at removing the air pollutants and toxins of the area. Much like the Peace Lily it can happily exist in even a low-light setting and can often bloom and produce berries as well.</div><div><br /><b>Aloe Vera</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The Aloe Vera plant is incredibly easy to grow and maintain, and like many of its counterparts is wonderful for filtering out air pollutants and toxins. However, what sets the Aloe Vera plant apart is the healing ability of the gel within each of its leaves. Rich in vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2, B12 and many more, the gel can effectively be used to help heal cuts and burns. Aloe has also been linked to assist with detoxification, alkalinity, digestion, the immune system, skin health and much more. It truly is a super plant that can even be easily grown in a small pot on a window sill.</div><div><br /><b>Rubber Plant (Ficus Elastica)</b></div><div><br />Like its name suggests, the Rubber Plant is one tough character capable of surviving and thriving in much less light and lower temperatures than most plants of its size. Of all Ficus plants tested, it scored the best in removing toxins and pollutants from the inside of homes.

From the perspective of a growing body of research, it is a truly medicinal food. This month, research published in the <i>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</i> found watermelon juice is an effective remedy for reducing the recovery heart rate and muscle soreness in athletes who were given 500 ml of watermelon juice (16.9 oz) containing 1.17 grams of the naturally occurring amino acid <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/citrulline">L-citrulline</a>.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn1">[1]</a><br /><div><br />Additional research indicates watermelon may possess the following health benefits:<br /><ul><li><i>Boosting Your Antioxidant Levels</i>: Watermelon is exceptionally rich in lycopene (hence its red color) and other carotenoids such as lutein and beta carotene.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn2">[2]</a> A 2003 study published in theJournal of Nutrition found that regular watermelon juice consumption resulted in significant increases in blood plasma concentrations of lycopene and beta carotene.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn3">[3]</a> Keep in mind that<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/lycopene">lycopene has been found to have over 40 potential health benefits</a>, and beta carotene (especially in its natural, food-complexed form) <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/beta-carotene">equally plentiful health benefits</a>, adding extra significance to this finding. Also, the watermelon-induced increase in plasma antioxidant levels may lend explanation to why an epidemiological study of the Chinese found greater watermelon intake to be associated with a lower risk of cancer.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn4">[4]</a></li><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><li><i>Reducing Blood Pressure/Improving Arterial Health</i>: A 2012 study published in the <i>American Journal of Hypertension</i> found that middle-aged obese subjects with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension who were given 6 weeks of treatment with a watermelon extract containing 6 grams of L-citrulline and L-arginine daily, experienced reduced ankle blood pressure and altered carotid wave reflection, an indication of improved arterial function.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn5">[5]</a> The inability of the blood vessels to dilate and function properly is known as <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/endothelial-dysfunction">endothelial dysfunction</a>, and is likely the most well-known initiating step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. If watermelon can ameliorate or reverse this process, it would certainly provide a breakthrough alternative to many of the drugs used for primary prevention, such as the cholesterol-lowering statin drug class, whose side effects, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/statin-drugs">numbering in the hundreds</a>, include <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/guide/health-guide-statin-drugs">heart muscle dysfunction</a> and damage.</li><li><i>Increasing Plasma Arginine Concentrations</i>: A 2007 study published in the journal Nutritionfound that watermelon juice consumption increases plasma arginine concentrations in adults, proving that the L-citrulline from this plant origin was effectively converted into arginine. This is a highly significant finding because arginine has a great number of health benefits, especially for ameliorating the aforementioned cardiovascular problem known as endothelial dysfunction. There are at least 20 studies in the biomedical literature documenting its <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/arginine?ed=5628">therapeutic role in improving endothelial dysfunction</a>, but you can view over 150 potential <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/arginine">health benefits of arginine</a> on the GreenMedInfo database.</li><li><i>Combatting Metabolic Syndrome</i>: A promising preclinical study published in the Journal of Nutrition in 2007 found that watermelon pomace, a rich source of L-citrulline, significantly improved metabolic syndrome in diabetic, overweight rats.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn6">[6]</a> This study is of particular interest because it lends support to relatively new research showing that <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/fruit-restriction-advice-type-2-diabetics-proven-wrong">fruit consumption is not harmful for type 2 diabetics</a>.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn7">[7]</a> The new study results were described as follows: "These results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for a beneficial effect of watermelon pomace juice as a functional food for increasing arginine availability, reducing serum concentrations of cardiovascular risk factors, improving glycemic control, and ameliorating vascular dysfunction in obese animals with type-II diabetes."</li><li><i>Watermelon Seeds, a Rich Source of Protein</i>:  It behooves us to mention the fact that all parts of the watermelon have something to offer. The seeds, in fact, are an excellent source of protein. A 2011 study published in the <i>Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology</i> found that "The good nutritional and functional properties of watermelon seed meal proteins suggest their potential use in food formulations."<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftn8">[8]</a>  While seedless watermelon are far more convenient to eat, keep in mind that they can not reproduce without human intervention and so there are several good reasons to choose seedless varieties.</li></ul><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>So, next time you are in the mood for watermelon, and are concerned about its notorious sugar content, 'weight-promoting effects,' and therefore possible diabetogenic and cardiotoxic properties – think again. Quality and moderation are the only things to make sure you are careful about when deciding to consume watermelon. Otherwise, enjoy it (remember <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/metabolic-power-pleasure">Vitamin P(leasure)</a>)and know that it may just be as good for you as it tastes.<br /><br /><b>Notes:&nbsp;</b></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/let-fruit-be-your-medicine-watermelons-remarkable-health-benefits-1#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Martha Patricia Tarazona-Díaz, Fernando Alacid, María Carrasco, Ignacio Martínez, Encarna Aguayo. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/watermelon-juices-andor-l-citrulline-help-reduce-recovery-heart-rate-and">Watermelon Juice: A Potential Functional Drink for Sore Muscle Relief in Athletes.</a>&nbsp;J Agric Food Chem. 2013 Jul 17.

This abject lack of "selective cytotoxicity" -- the ability to kill only the cancer cells and not healthy ones  -- is what makes Adriamycin so dangerous. And yet, it has been a first-line treatment for a wide range of cancers for almost half a century.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Since the 1996 study, little research on graviola was performed. There was a cell study in 1999 which showed it had anti-<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/graviola-annona-muricata-contains-compounds-cytotoxic-effects-against-prostate-and-pancreati">prostate cancer</a> and breast cancer activity; another 2002 cell study showed that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/graviola-annona-muricata-contains-compounds-cytotoxic-effects-against-human-hepatoma-cell-li">graviola</a> exhibited anti-hepatoma (liver cancer) activity, but nothing as promising as the original 1996 study ever followed.  <br /><br />Then, in 2011, the journal <i>Nutrition and Cancer</i> revealed highly promising research on graviola and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/graviola-selectively-suppresses-human-breast-cancer-cells">breast cancer</a>. Researchers found that graviola fruit extract (GFE) suppressed so-called oncogene (or cancer-causing gene) expression in the cell and animal models of breast cancer. The oncogene known as <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/pharmacological-action/epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-egfr-inhibitor">epidermal growth factor receptor</a> (EGFR) is commonly over-expressed in breast cancer, and therefore an ideal target for therapy.  <br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" /></a>According to the researchers<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">A a 5-wk dietary treatment of GFE (200 mg/kg diet) significantly reduced the protein expression of EGFR, p-EGFR, and p-ERK in MDA-MB-468 [breast cancer] tumors by 56%, 54%, and 32.5%, respectively. Overall, dietary GFE inhibited tumor growth, as measured by wet weight, by 32% (P &lt; 0.01).</blockquote>The study authors concluded<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">These data showed that dietary GFE induced significant growth inhibition of MDA-MB-468 cells in vitro and in vivo through a mechanism involving the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that <b>GFE may have a protective effect for women against EGFR-overexpressing BC [breast cancer].</b>&nbsp;[emphasis added]</blockquote>Given these findings the time may be ripe for reconsideration of graviola in the prevention and/or treatment of cancers, such as colon and breast cancer. <br /><br /><i>Article originally posted at <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/fruit-extract-10000-times-better-chemo">GreenMedInfo</a> <br /><br />Sayer Ji is an author, researcher, lecturer, and advisory board member of the National Health Federation.

They also contain glycerine which form a protective coating on your teeth.<br /><br />Not so bad, you might think? Think again. The glycerine prevents the beneficial minerals in your saliva from penetrating into your teeth (which are alive by the way) leading to mineral deficiencies.<br /><br />Instead of using the toxic commercial varieties, why not make your own?  It’s simple and quick.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Whenever possible, I try to make my own EVERYTHING as it usually ends up be cheaper in the long run, in addition to a whole lot healthier as I can control the quality of the ingredients.<br /><br /><i>Ingredients</i>:<br />1/2 cup aluminum free baking soda<br />5 drops peppermint <a href="http://www.doterra.myvoffice.com/erinrschumacher/">essential oil</a><br />2 drops cinnamon or clove<a href="http://www.doterra.myvoffice.com/erinrschumacher/"> essential oil</a><br /><br />Mix all the ingredients in a jar with a lid.

Words that, for many people, hover in the grey area between fantasy and ambitious dreams. Billions of dollars are spent each year on theories, new treatments and new disappointments. The painful road to recovery has many affected individuals seeking natural remedies and treatments, if only to avoid the harsh cycle of surgery-chemo-radiology-remission.<br /><br /></div><div>But what if there was a way to boost your own body's defenses against unnatural cancer cells?&nbsp;</div><div><br />T-cells are white blood cells that attack and destroy cells infected by viruses, and even some cancer cells. However, many types of cancer mutate and develop protection against these cells, making it very difficult for the body to fight tumorous growths.<br /><br /></div><div><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Enter Immunocore. This small company based in Oxfordshire has spent the last 20 years focusing their research on enhancing T-Cells to combat this these types of cancerous tumors. Watch in the video below as a T-cell attacks and absorbs a cancer cell.<br /><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jgJKaP0Sj5U" width="560"></iframe>  <br /><br />The premise is this. While the body's natural immune system usually does a fantastic job recognizing and neutralizing outside threats, antibodies are not usually formed with a genetic predisposition to recognize cells. When cancer cells form, with their structure 'disguised' they are almost invisible to the killer cells. The body recognizes that there is a threat, which activates the immune system and triggers the high white blood cell counts that so often lead to cancer testing. But the killer T-Cells are unable to remove the cancer from the body.<br /><br />What Dr. Brent Jakobsen, chief scientific officer at immunocore, and his team are developing are small protein molecules that act as a glue, attaching solely to cancer cells. The other end of the protein is designed to attach to the protruding 'receptor' proteins located on the exterior of the T-Cells. They are basically designing a target for the T-Cells receptor to attach to. Think of a soldier using a laser to mark a target for an air-strike. The ImmTACs, as Immunocore calls them, are the matchmakers forcing the introduction of the T-Cells to the cancerous invaders.<br /><br />The ImmTACs have been designed to recognize the difference between cancer cells, and the normal, healthy cells that make up our organs and tissues. On the surface of every cell are small proteins known as peptides, which Dr. Jakobsen explained this way:<br /><blockquote>All these little peptides tell you the story of the cell. The forest of them on the cell surface is a sort of display saying 'I am this kind of cell. This is my identity and this is everything going on inside me'.</blockquote></div><div><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kADbI3spO2M/TwILKt_It9I/AAAAAAAANvU/F0N-dw_gGR4/s261/cancer.png" /></a>Immunocore is building a database of cancer cells' 'peptide signature' to enhance the efficiency of their treatment, and also protect healthy cells, thereby limiting side effects and potential harm.<br /><br />The treatment would not be without risk. T-Cells are some of the most powerful operators in our body's universe, but their potency is what makes them attractive as a possible cure.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">You can never make a single-mechanism drug that would come anywhere near a T-cell in terms of its potency.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you want to make an impact on cancer you need something that is incredibly potent – but when something goes wrong, it goes badly wrong. I think the honest truth about all cancer treatments is that no matter how much we test and do beforehand, it will continue to go wrong sometimes. - Dr. Jakobsen</blockquote></div><div>And this is certainly the case in past trials of immunotherapy. In 2006, a <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-po/documents/websiteresources/con2023519.pdf">clinical trial</a> in London resulted in disastrous side effects for the patients involved. The trial was conducted by Parexel, a contract research organization. Administration of the antibody during the trial caused 6 individuals to experience 'Cytokine Release Syndrome' - a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response that hospitalized the subjects. This certainly would not be helpful to someone already suffering from cancer and related maladies.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Immunocore seems confident that they have identified the potential dangers and claim to be taking every step to ensure the safety of future recipients of the drug. Only time will tell. Recent trials of low doses of the medication showed promise on melanoma patients, with minimal side effects. Large-scale clinical trials are still years away at this point, however.<br /><br /></div><div><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text/Image */ google_ad_slot = "1104481866"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br /></div><div>Big Pharma has also taken note of Immunocore's success, leading to the signing of two contracts with major corporations. This will lead to a massive increase in funding for Dr. Jakobsen and his team, but could also lead to exclusion and priority treatments based on who holds the patents to the formula. Based on the track record of the pharmaceutical industry, even if a cure is found, it will likely be decades before the general public can avail themselves of it ... or afford it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Dr. Jakobsen said this:</div><div><blockquote class="tr_bq">All the pharma companies have come to the realization that immunotherapy may hold the ultimate key to cancer; it is the missing link in cancer treatment that can give cures.</blockquote>And as with any other profitable resource, when large companies take note, wish it a fond farewell.

Subjects were randomized to receive either a six week treatment with fluoxetine (20 mg) and curcumin (1000 mg) individually or their combination.<br /><br />Success of the treatment was evaluated using the 17-item <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depression">Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</a> (HAM-D17). The results were reported as follows:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">We observed that curcumin was well tolerated by all the patients.

This study provides first clinical evidence that curcumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.</b> [emphasis added]</blockquote><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Discussion</b><br /><br />If the results of this relatively small trial are applicable to a wider population, this is truly groundbreaking news. There was already a rather sizable body of preclinical research indicating that curcumin is an effective antidepressant in the animal model,<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/groundbreaking-study-finds-turmeric-extract-superior-prozac-depression#_ftn2">[2]</a> but this was not enough to sway most physicians who practice so-called "evidence based medicine" into actually suggesting it to patients as a Prozac or antidepressant alternative. And this is understandable, as the lack of solid human clinical evidence supporting the use of a natural substance is no small matter from a legal-regulatory perspective. Unless a substance has passed through the approximately 800 million dollar financial gauntlet of phase I, II, and III clinical trials required to apply for FDA drug approval, and has actually received that approval, there is <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-law-forbids-medicinal-use-natural-substances">scant legal protection for those who use natural medicines</a> to prevent or treat disease and who might face a lawsuit, frivolous or genuine, as a result of a claim of injury. <br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>Curcumin, of course, is extremely safe, with a 2010 phase I safety study finding that oral doses as high as 8 grams a day were well tolerated.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/groundbreaking-study-finds-turmeric-extract-superior-prozac-depression#_ftn3">[3]</a>  Fluoxetine, on the other hand, is highly controversial due to its well-known toxicity, and its laundry list of side effects, which include suicidal ideation (not a good side effect for someone already depressed!). <br /><br />Also, even though it would appear the study found that curcumin and Prozac were equivalent in effectiveness, the fact that curcumin comes "...without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders," clearly proves its superiority over Prozac. There are also a wide range of additional side benefits that come with using curcumin, including its powerful neuroprotective properties. You will find no less than 109 studies on our database documenting curcumin's ability to protect, and in some cases restore brain function.

What I have uncovered will shock many readers because I have discovered that innocent women and girls in developing countries have been deliberately experimented on, with the use of infertility vaccines, for many years.<br /><br />They are not the only victims. Recently several vaccines used worldwide have also been found to cause infertility, including the HPV vaccines and many of the swine flu vaccines.<br /><br />My interest in the subject began after it was reported that the Japanese government had decided to withdraw its support for the HPV vaccine schedule. This decision came after the government received approximately 2000 reports from women and girls suffering adverse reactions, including long-term pain, numbness, paralysis and infertility. [1]<br /><br />This does not mean that Japan has banned or suspended the program, as the vaccines will still be available to anyone wishing to receive them. However, the medical provider will automatically inform anyone wishing to receive the HPV vaccines Gardasil or Cervarix that the Japanese government no longer supports the HPV vaccine program.<br />This Shot Changed One Girl’s Life Forever<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Over the years, a range of adverse reactions have been reported worldwide after the HPV vaccinations. However, the discovery that the HPV vaccine has been found to cause infertility in some women has only been publicized more recently.<br /><br />In 2012, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published a paper by Dr. Deidrie Little titled "Premature Ovarian Failure 3 Years After Menarche in a 16 Year-Old Girl Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination," in which Dr. Little detailed the case of a sixteen year-old girl suffering from premature menopause after receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil. The summary of the paper states:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Premature ovarian failure in a well adolescent is a rare event. Its occurrence raises important questions about causation, which may signal other systemic concerns. This patient presented with amenorrhoea after identifying a change from her regular cycle to irregular and scant periods following vaccinations against human papillomavirus. She declined the oral contraceptives initially prescribed for amenorrhoea. The diagnostic tasks were to determine the reason for her secondary amenorrhoea and then to investigate for possible causes of the premature ovarian failure identified.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Although the cause is unknown in 90% of cases, the remaining chief identifiable causes of this condition were excluded. Premature ovarian failure was then notified as a possible adverse event following this vaccination. The young woman was counselled regarding preservation of bone density, reproductive implications and relevant follow-up. This event could hold potential implications for population health and prompts further inquiry. [2]</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccinetruth.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" height="175" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-38G3VOJQToQ/TfAZ2bc-qRI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/LA-TGAvVeWk/250x250-b.jpg" width="200" /></a>As the BMJ charges a fee to read their articles, interested readers can find a report about the case on the Weekly Briefing of the Population Research Institute’s website. The report states that Dr. Little said that before the sixteen year-old received the vaccine Gardasil during the fall of 2008, her menstrual cycle was perfectly normal. However, by January 2009, her cycle had become irregular, and over the course of the next two years, her menses (bleeds) had become increasingly irregular. By 2011, she had ceased menstruating altogether.<br /><br />The Weekly Briefing stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In the Australian case, after testing the levels of numerous hormones, and the function of various internal organs, the girl was diagnosed by Dr. Little as having “premature ovarian failure”, which is defined as “the presence of menopausal gonadotrophin levels in association with over 3 months of amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea before age 40 years.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Further testing confirmed that all of her eggs—every last one—were dead. She was and is totally and irrevocably infertile.</blockquote>The Weekly Briefing article has since been removed, but a complete copy of the article can be found on several websites, including Population Research Institute. [3]<br /><br /><b>Thousands of Women Are Now Infertile Because of Vaccines</b><br /><br />It is extremely unusual for a girl of this age to enter early menopause. So, we must ask ourselves, was it the vaccine that caused her symptoms or was it something else?<br /><br />I decided to research if there were any other reports or papers on the subject of vaccination and infertility. I was horrified by what I discovered.<br /><br />I found a total of 56 research papers listed on PubMed relating to contraceptive vaccines, dating as far back as 1977. No doubt a researcher entering a range of different search terms could come up with many more. [4]<br /><br />This led me to question whether or not vaccines were being manufactured deliberately to cause infertility. One paper in particular, published in 1989, written by G.P. Talwar and R. Raghupathy titled Anti-Fertility Vaccines appears to suggest that they are. The authors stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Vaccines are under development for the control of fertility in males and females. This review discusses developments in anti-fertility vaccines at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">A single injection procedure for the sterilization or castration of male animals depending on the site at which the injection is given, has passed through field testing and is expected to be on the market in the near future. [5]</blockquote>It is difficult to judge from this abstract whether these vaccines were being developed for use on humans or animals. However, further research has led me to believe that these vaccines were being developed for humans, because not long after this paper was published, vaccines were administered to women and children in a number of countries, including Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines, causing many of them to become infertile.<br /><br /><b>Why Weren’t Men or Boys Given This “Tetanus” Vaccine?</b><br /><br />In 1994, the World Health Organization gave many women in developing countries aged between 15 and 45 a tetanus vaccine containing a birth control drug.<br /><br />An organization known as The Comite became suspicious of the protocols surrounding the vaccines and obtained several vials for testing. It was discovered that some of the vials contained human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a naturally occurring hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy.<br /><br />However, when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier, this vaccine essentially causes a woman’s body to produce antibodies against pregnancy, forcing her body to abort her unborn baby. The ThinkTwice Global Vaccine Institute, reporting on the story, stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In nature the hCG hormone alerts the woman’s body that she is pregnant and causes the release of other hormones to prepare the uterine lining for the implantation of the fertilized egg. The rapid rise in hCG levels after conception makes it an excellent marker for confirmation of pregnancy: when a woman takes a pregnancy test she is not tested for the pregnancy itself, but for the elevated presence of hCG.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">However, when introduced into the body coupled with a tetanus toxoid carrier, antibodies will be formed not only against tetanus but also against hCG. In this case the body fails to recognize hCG as a friend and will produce anti-hCG antibodies. The antibodies will attack subsequent pregnancies by killing the hCG which naturally sustains a pregnancy; when a woman has sufficient anti-hCG antibodies in her system, she is rendered incapable of maintaining a pregnancy. [6]</blockquote>Curiously, no men, boys or babies were vaccinated during the program. The only people vaccinated with this particular vaccine were women aged between 15 and 45. Was it a coincidence that these vaccines were only given to women of childbearing age? After all, anyone can contract tetanus, can’t they?<br /><br />If The Comite had not become suspicious, then no one would have been any wiser. However, the question now remains: Was this a deliberate attempt by the WHO to reduce the population? The answer may lay in a paper written in 1997.<br /><br /><b>Girls and Women as Fertility Control Guinea Pigs</b><br /><br />In 1997, another paper by G.P. Talwar titled Vaccines for Control of Fertility and Hormone Dependent Cancers was published by Immunology and Cell Biology. The author stated in the introduction:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The twentieth century is marked by an unprecedented rise in the population. Four billion people will be added to the world population in 73 years of this century, whereas the global population attained the two billion mark only in 1927. In India, the population increases by 18 million per year, equivalent to the entire population of Australia.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Although a number of methods are available for contraception, they are not suited to many people in economically developing countries and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the contraceptive needs of 350 million couples are unmet. [7]</blockquote>At first glance, it appears that the scientists were trying to develop a vaccine to use as an alternative method of contraception, to be offered at fertility clinics; that is, until you read deeper into the paper.<br /><br />On page 185 in the section titled Operational Strategy, the author stated:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Both hCG and LHRH are self hormones in humans and are poor antigens. To improve their immunogenicity, they are derivatized with haptenic groups as followed by Stevens ct al. in their initial studies or they are chemically linked to carriers to enlist T helper cell activity. We used carriers, first tetanus toxoid (TT) and later diphtheria toxoid (DT) or cholera toxin chain B (CTB). Tetanus accounts a large mortality of women at the time of delivery, which in developing countries, often occurs in places other than maternity homes/clinics. TT conjugates conferred immunoprophylactic benefit against tetanus, besides overcoming immunological tolerance to the self hormone. Diversification of carriers on repeat immunization avoided hyperimmunization against a given carrier and carrier-induced immunosuppression.</blockquote>Reading on, the section titled Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, reads as follows:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Human chorionic gonadotropin was a preferred choice as a target for a contraceptive vaccine of three groups of investigators. Although the existence of’ leaky genes making small amounts of hCG in the non-pregnant state has been observed by William Odell. the hormone thus made is not conspicuous in its bioactivity nor appreciable in amount, hCG is a definite marker of pregnancy, when trophoblastic and other tumours are excluded. Its synthesis and secretion begins at the pre-implantation stage, as observed in the vitro-fertilized human embryo. It is involved in implantation since marmoset (south or central American monkey) embryos exposed to anti-phCG antibodies do not implant.’</blockquote>The author continued by adding:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Interception of conception by anti-hCG antibodies is also supported by phase II clinical trials where no lengthening of the luteal phase was observed in women who were protected from becoming pregnant. As pregnancy is deemed to begin only after implantation of the embryo to the endometrium. hCG vaccine by preventing it is not an abortifacient but a contraceptive vaccine. hCG is also required for corpus luteum support and production of progesterone during the first 7 weeks until the placenta takes over. It thus has a role in both establishing and supporting pregnancy. Its chemistry was known by the early 1970s and it could be purified from pregnancy urine.</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8n0lSATEOvA/UHClnvZ78iI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_hdaYp5kbtA/s250/legal-vaccine.jpg" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a>These vaccines appear to be strikingly similar to the vaccines that were given to the women in developing countries for tetanus in 1994, just three years earlier, which were also found to contain the hormone hCG.<br /><br />So, were the women and children living in developing countries in 1994 deliberately experimented on? It certainly appears that they were, as the vaccine trials using the tetanus vaccine on women and girls of childbearing age took place three years before this paper was written.<br /><br />Another point that should be mentioned here is the fact that these trials were unethical, and yet there is no mention of an ethics committee. Were members of an ethics committee ever consulted before any of these vaccines were administered?<br /><br /><b>Massive Increase in Fetal Deaths After Pregnant Moms Receive Flu Vaccine</b><br /><br />The tetanus vaccines were given in the 1990s and yet vaccines are said to be causing infertility still today. Other than the HPV vaccines, which I discussed earlier, Fluarix, the vaccine manufactured by GSK against the swine flu, has also been reported to cause infertility. [8]<br /><br />In fact, the information given on the prescribing information sheet states that the vaccine has not been evaluated for the impairment of fertility and that it is not known whether Fluarix can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or if it can affect reproduction capacity. [9]<br /><br />In other words, it is possible that this vaccine can lead to infertility!<br /><br />Despite this information being readily available on the Internet, pregnant women are still being recommended to receive various flu vaccines every year.<br /><br />Documentation received from the National Coalition of Organized Women (NCOW) states that between 2009 and 2010, the mercury-laden combined flu vaccinations increased Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Systems (VAERS) fetal death reports by 4,250 percent in pregnant women.<br /><br />Eileen Danneman from NCOW stated that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) deliberately misled the nation’s obstetricians and gynecologists and colluded with the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (AJOG) to mislead the public by advertising the flu vaccine as a safe vaccine for pregnant women when they knew fully well that it was causing a massive spike in fetal deaths. [10]<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />What I have discovered, I am sure that many would agree, is absolutely horrific. It appears that many of the recommended vaccinations are known by the governments and pharmaceutical industries to cause infertility. Many of these vaccines are mandatory. We need to ask ourselves why our governments are deliberately force-vaccinating us with vaccines known to cause infertility.<br /><br />Another question we need to ask is why are so many studies being funded to study the subject area surrounding vaccines and infertility.<br /><br />Many leading professionals believe that these vaccines are being offered as part of a global depopulation plan. We need to ask ourselves whether or not our governments have the right to play God with our lives without our knowledge or consent.<br /><br />I believe it is high time that we took back the control of our own lives and researched all vaccinations thoroughly before we agree to be vaccinated. Ultimately, it is each person’s decision whether or not they should be vaccinated, and the only way that we can make an informed choice about vaccinations is to be fully informed of the facts before agreeing to be vaccinated.<br /><br />I have proven, by referencing documents, articles and scientific papers, that a series of vaccines are being developed that are known to cause infertility. These vaccines have been and still are being administered to innocent people without their knowledge or consent. Surely, this practice is not only unethical, it is criminal.<br /><br /><b>References:</b><br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041099_gardasil_side_effect_japan_infertility.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/041099_gardasil_side_effect_japan_infertility.html</a><br /><br />2. <a href="http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2012/bcr-2012-006879.abstract">http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2012/bcr-2012-006879.abstract</a><br /><br />3. <a href="http://pop.org/content/teenage-girl-becomes-infertile-after-gardasil-vaccination">http://pop.org/content/teenage-girl-becomes-infertile-after-gardasil-vaccination</a><br /><br />4. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;TransSchema=title&amp;term=contraceptive+vaccine">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed…</a><br /><br />5. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2665354">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2665354</a><br /><br />6. <a href="http://thinktwice.com/birthcon.htm">http://thinktwice.com/birthcon.htm</a><br /><br />7. <a href="http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v75/n2/abs/icb199726a.html">http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v75/n2/abs/icb199726a.html</a><br /><br />8. <a href="http://www.infowars.com/polysorbate-80-in-swine-flu-vaccines-infertility-in-humans/">http://www.infowars.com/polysorbate-80-in-swine-flu-vaccines-infertility-in-humans/</a><br /><br />9. <a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/pdf/FLUARIX_2009LatestPackageInsert_us_fluarix.pdf">http://preventdisease.com/news/pdf/FLUARIX_2009LatestPackageInsert_us_fluarix.pdf</a><br /><br />10. <a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/11/23/flu-shot-spikes-fetal-death/#sthash.eg67UXq2.dpuf">http://vactruth.com/2012/11/23/flu-shot-spikes-fetal-death/#sthash.eg67UXq2.dpuf</a><br /><br /><i>This article first appeared at VacTruth:</i><br /><a href="http://vactruth.com/2013/07/20/vaccines-can-cause-infertility/">http://vactruth.com/2013/07/20/vaccines-can-cause-infertility/</a><br /><br /><i>Christina was born and educated in London, U.K. She left school to work in a children's library, specializing in story telling and book buying. In 1978 Christina changed her career path to dedicate her time to caring for the elderly and was awarded the title of Care Giver of the Year for her work with the elderly in 1980. In 1990 she adopted the first of two disabled boys, both with challenging behavior, complex disabilities and medical needs. In 1999 she was accused of Munchausen by Proxy after many failed attempts to get the boys’ complex needs met. Finally, she was cleared of all accusations after the independent psychologist Lisa Blakemore-Brown gave both boys the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD as part of what she described to be a complex tapestry of disorders. During the assessments Ms Blakemore-Brown discovered through the foster care diaries that the eldest boy had reacted adversely to the MMR vaccine. After taking an A Level in Psychology and a BTEC in Learning Disabilities Ms. England spent many years researching vaccines and adverse reactions. She went on to gain a Higher National Diploma in journalism and media and currently writes for the American Chronicle, the Weekly Blitz, VacTruth and Namaste Publishing UK on immunization safety and efficacy whilst continuing to study for a BA Honors degree in English Literature and Humanities.

The refrigerator and air conditioning will not be working and excessive heat can be dangerous for the elderly, the very young and for many with chronic medical conditions.<br /><br />Here are 12 ways to keep your cool when the temperature soars.<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>If you have an attic or loft open the hatch/door to allow the hot air to keep on rising rather than staying in the areas you use more often.</li><li>Just as we advise people to stay warm in one room in very cold weather if you have a room that’s cooler than all the rest use it in preference to the other rooms in the house.</li><li>Put your hands into a bowl of cold water. Your hands have a large surface area and the blood vessels at the wrist are near the surface. Putting your hands into a bowl of cool water will chill the blood a little as it passes through and help keep your temperature within normal limits. Dipping your feet into cool water has the same effect.</li><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><li>On the same theme a cool cloth on the back of your neck will make you feel much cooler almost instantly.</li><li>Use natural cotton bedding if you have it, it will soak up sweat much more effectively than synthetics and will save that slick clammy feeling on humid nights.</li><li>If you are really struggling at night wet your hair. You will feel much cooler and the water evaporating will cool you down even more.</li><li>Draw the curtains on the sunny side of the house before the room heats up. Open those and close others as the sun moves during the day.</li><li>Establish which windows provide the best airflow through the house. Depending on where your walls and doors are you can often get a decent flow of cooler air by opening certain windows. Biggest is not always best where windows are concerned.</li><li>Don’t have a cold shower. Immersion in cold water will shut down the blood flow to the skin and trap the heat inside you. Tepid bathing is far better as the blood keeps flowing cooling as it nears the skin  taking that cooled blood around your body which in turn makes life more comfortable.</li><li>Loose clothing is a must. Tight clothing prevents the evaporation of sweat and it’s evaporation that makes you feel cooler. Loose cotton clothing is better still.</li><li>Eat spicy food. This may sound odd but spicy foods contain capsaicin which makes you sweat, and as I said it’s sweat evaporating that causes heat loss and cools you down.</li><li>Dampen your clothes. The heat of your body will dry the clothes and it’s this heat exchange that produces the cooling effect.</li></ol>Remember that once you start to feel thirsty you are starting to dehydrate. Ensure adequate fluid intake during hot weather. Heat stroke kills fast and the death toll soars during heat waves.<br /><br />Going swimming was not included because, to be honest, in a crisis the last thing on my mind would be taking off to the beach.<br /><div><br /></div><div><i>This article appeared at <a href="http://undergroundmedic.com/disaster-management12-ways-to-keep-cool-without-electricity/" target="_blank">Underground Medic</a></i></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stirlinggenerator.html" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p80xQ7D2vMs/UCEoWWD2VzI/AAAAAAAARNI/GjPD1Mlb5gA/s468/038_468x60_2.gif" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/07/disaster-management12-ways-to-keep-cool.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Activist)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-07-18T05:18:18.719-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:92:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p1A-G6sfiQY/UeeFDiRoGLI/AAAAAAAACFo/x20WACc1xUA/s72-c/images3.jpeg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4446947302163364668.post-2139996135275495239";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:51:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"environment";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"hemp";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Joe-Martino";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"natural-health-blog";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"natural-health-news";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Hemp vs Cotton: The Ultimate Showdown";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8753:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hyoaqxRDNKU/UebYNTSH2QI/AAAAAAAARC8/qyYOBiIJspU/s1600/hempcott-300x199.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hyoaqxRDNKU/UebYNTSH2QI/AAAAAAAARC8/qyYOBiIJspU/s320/hempcott-300x199.png" width="310" /></a></div>by <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/Joe-Martino">Joe Martino</a><br /><br />Hemp has been making a lot of noise lately, especially with the growing awareness surrounding the use of hemp oil for treating cancer. Although the word ‘hemp’ still often gets confused and lumped into the same definition as Cannabis, a similar but psychoactive plant, it’s important to realize hemp can be a major game changer for our world if used to its potential.<br /><br />As we go through this post, you will be wondering ‘why don’t we use this stuff all the time...for everything?!’ Simple answer, farming hemp was banned in the US and other countries in the 1937 because of the threat it caused to certain companies and their businesses. <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2012/12/05/how-hemp-became-illegal-the-marijuana-link/">More about that here.</a><br /><br />Although hemp has many <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2012/04/01/5-ways-hemp-will-change-our-world/">practical uses</a>, let’s focus on one that would affect us every day; clothing. For this, we will compare hemp to cotton, as cotton is a very popular resource used in clothing production. We’ll need to focus on various areas that have to be taken into consideration when comparing the two so we can determine not only what is better for us, but also what is best for our environment as it’s important to view things holistically. Let’s do it.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Water</b><br /><br /><i>Cotton</i>: To grow cotton you require about 1400 gallons of water for every pound you intend to produce. That’s a lot of water! Some areas of the world that produce cotton are running out of fresh water due to the production of cotton as well as clothing. Some areas of the world have even experienced desertification as a result of producing cotton.<br /><br /><i>Hemp</i>: You require about half the amount of water to produce hemp as you would if producing cotton. Hemp is a strong and reliable plant that grows very quickly. Not only that, hemp produces about 200% – 250% more fiber on the same amount of land compared to cotton.<br /><br /><i>The victor: Hemp</i><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Pesticides</b><br /><i><br /></i><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organics.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5nLmWzKFs60/URRNIOJzCiI/AAAAAAAAUEc/HqENLf1jZeM/s250/BANNER150.jpg" /></a><i>Cotton</i>: One of the biggest downsides to cotton is how much pesticides are used to grow the plant. Although organic cotton farming is beginning to catch on a bit more, the production of cotton worldwide takes up about 25% of the world’s pesticide use. The other unfortunate factor is that these chemicals can end up being absorbed into our skin as we wear our clothing.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Hemp</i>: The beauty of hemp is that it requires no pesticides to grow. In fact, it doesn’t require any chemicals at all to grow. The growing nature of the plant competes with weeds and overpowers their ability to sustain themselves. This allows the hemp plant to grow freely and quickly.<br /><br /><i>The victor: Hemp</i><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Comfort &amp; Longevity</b><br /><br /><i>Cotton</i>: Generally very comfortable to begin with, as you continue to wear cotton it ‘breaks in’ to become even more comfortable. There is no denying how soft cotton can be, but it is also true that cotton fibers break down over time, and the more it is washed the faster it breaks down.<br /><br /><i>Hemp</i>: The hemp fiber used in clothing is a strong natural fiber that, like cotton, gets progressively softer with each passing day you wear it and each time you wash it. Although it may not start off quite as soft, it is still soft and certainly would not be considered uncomfortable. The plus is that the fiber is much stronger and more durable. Repeated washing will not break the fiber down anywhere near as quickly as cotton. Creating more hemp clothing would mean we would need to produce much less clothing.<br /><br /><i>The victor: Hemp</i><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Breathability &amp; Wicking</b><br /><br /><i>Cotton</i>: Breathability is certainly a strong suit for cotton. It also does not hold odors very much. This is quite possibly one of the biggest downsides to synthetic fibers; they don’t dispel odor well and don’t often deal with moisture well either. While cotton has a natural wicking system, it also holds moisture a little longer than what might be considered most desirable.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a><i>Hemp</i>: Performs very well when it comes to breathability and wicks moisture away from the body effectively. Hemp also carries anti-bacterial properties that trump any other natural fiber. This means hemp will not mold or grow mildew very easily. Since it also does not hold odors, hemp clothing edges out cotton slightly on this one<br /><br /><i>The victor: Almost a tie, but hemp is our pal on this one again</i><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Aesthetics</b><br /><i><br /></i> <i>Cotton</i>: Without the use of dyes, cotton comes naturally in white, cream and off-white. Cotton can be dyed naturally or synthetically to achieve a desired color. The growing knowledge that cotton is very taxing on the environment and not healthy for our skin is creating quite the demand for organic cotton. In terms of the fashion market, organic cotton is showing up more and more.<br /><br /><i>Hemp</i>: Given the various processes available to remove fibers from the stem of a hemp plant, hemp can be naturally creamy white, black, green, grey or brown. Without even requiring the use of dye, hemp comes in a variety of colors. Of course, you are still able to dye hemp both naturally and synthetically. Hemp is quickly becoming more and more popular in the fashion market as designers see the potential in the material while being a very environmentally sound option. Since it is durable and lasts a long time, it can be attractive to certain designers.<br /><br /><i>The victor: Hemp</i><br /><b><br /></b> <b>Final Decision</b><br /><br />Winner by knockout and growing undisputed champion of natural harmony, HEMP! This isn’t to say that cotton, especially grown organically, is not a good material; it simply isn’t better all around than hemp. In some cases, cotton could be a must use if something specific is being produced. The biggest differences are in the facts that hemp requires much less water and no pesticides to produce. Not only that, it boasts a lot more fiber per acre. Concerned about excess CO2 in the atmosphere? Hemp is spectacular at sequestering CO2! Take the time to check out some hemp clothing around the Internet or see if there are some local stores that sell it. Although options can sometimes be limited right now, look out for more hemp clothing as awareness continues to spread!<br /><br /><i>Hey, name's Joe and you are currently engaged in what I'm passionate about, <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/">C</a><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/">ollective Evolution</a>.

It does not matter how much PR money Monsanto spends, people all over the world are realizing the truth.<br /><br />Last year’s first real independent <a href="http://www.altheadlines.com/gmo-genetically-modified-organism/">GMO</a>&nbsp;study conducted in Europe demonstrated the long-term effects of GMO corn and the effects of Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup fed to rats. The tumor growth rate of the lab rats fed a GMO diet was alarming.<br /><div><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><br />This sparked a huge grassroots movement culminating into the <a href="http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/">March Against Monsanto</a>, which took place on May 25th 2013 and drew in millions of people in over 400 cities across the world. Finally humanity is waking up to the reality of GMOs.<br /><br />In April 2013, MIT scientist Stephanie Snell PhD, co-author of a top study on glyphosate, explained in an interview how this chemical, which is the broad-spectrum systemic herbicide used by Monsanto in Roundup, is quite toxic to our health. The transcript of the interview is <a href="http://www.altheadlines.com/glyphosate-and-roundups-implications-on-modern-diseases-13249157">available here</a>.<br /><div><br /><b>How Does Monsanto Get Away With It?</b><br /><b><br /></b>Monsanto and all these other big corporate giants depend on your acquiescence in order to succeed. They spend billions of dollars combined in PR campaigns and advertisements counting on mass public ignorance in order to continue pumping profitable GMO and toxic herbicides into our food system.</div><div><br /><b>Non-Compliance to Monsanto Means Compliance to Your Best Interests</b><br /><br /></div><div><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-khc-CD__YDo/UVM3nxnfDEI/AAAAAAAAUmE/RRSuc0x5jzk/s125/125X125.jpg" /></a>The best form of activism is to become a leader, that is, leading by example. You may not have participated in the March Against Monsanto nor do you have to be on the front line protesting against GMOs to take a stand. Activism starts with standing up for yourself in even the smallest of ways. Anyone can start flipping the bird to Monsanto today by making better choices and honoring your bodies and minds. By complying with yourself every day you are in fact not adhering to and supporting a system that really is a house of cards.The more we comply with our own self interests for the betterment of humanity, these giants will eventually fall or have to change.<br /><div><br /><div><b>Vote With Your Dollars</b><br /><b><br /></b>One of the biggest misconceptions that the public is indoctrinated with is the perception that,  “I am one individual, what difference can I make?” In reality we all have the power to affect change and it really does start with what we do in our lives and our buying habits. Put your dollars to work in the local economy by supporting local stores, your local farmers and start breaking the chains from the big department stores which all carry GMOs. Let’s keep the profits in our local economies and reward our local farmers for trying to do the right thing. There are many programs, which are called community-supported agriculture or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture">CSA</a> where you can start to make an impact by supporting a local farmers and keeping them away from the grips of Monsanto.</div><div><br /><b>Top Ways to Fight GMOs on a Daily Basis</b><br /><b><br /></b><i>Food choices:</i> Begin by making better food choices and nourishing your body by getting rid of all GMOs. The biggest GMO offenders are corn and soy, in addition to some wheat sources, which unfortunately are ingredients in most processed foods.<br /><br />Switch to an organic diet of mainly fruits and vegetables along with lean meats and nuts. Many people have reported that after they get off &nbsp;GMO foods, that within a few weeks they start feeling a lot better.<br /><br /><i>Start juicing:</i> Getting in the <a href="http://www.juicingforweightloss.com/">habit of juicing</a> organic non-GMO&nbsp;fruits and vegetables, even if just 2 to 3 times a week. This is a great way to start loading your body with highly bio-available nutrition. The reason why juicing is so important is twofold. First, you are able to consume the nutrition of substantially more fruits and vegetables than you typically could eat in one sitting, while also helping support local organic farmers by purchasing more fruits and vegetables than you normally would.<br /><br /><i>Plant a Garden:</i> This is one of the best ways you can cost effectively have full control over where your fruits and vegetables are coming from.  Even if you can’t take care of all your needs, this can help supplement what you are buying from local organic farmers. Every dollar you are not spending on GMO products helps to change the system.<br /><br /></div><div><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text/Image */ google_ad_slot = "1104481866"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Change Begins With You</b><br /><b><br /></b>As the character, Howard Beale in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/"><i>Network</i></a>&nbsp;famously exclaims; "I’m a human being God dammit my life has value," we as a society also need to come to this realization and not let our health be compromised in the name of corporate interests and profits. It’s time to affect change every day by the small choices we make in our lives. It’s time to disconnect from the propaganda that the big corporate giants such as Monsanto perpetuate on society, so we can stand tall in our own existence and comply with humanity's best interests. Through leading by example we are in fact flipping the bird to those who do not care about us and only want to profit from our lack of knowledge.<br /><br />Please leave your comments below; I’d like to hear your thoughts and suggestions on all the ways we can comply with our best interest and stop acquiescing to any big business or agendas.<br /><br /><i>Eric Draven writes for <a href="http://www.altheadlines.com/">ALT Headlines</a> where this article <a href="http://www.altheadlines.com/top-ways-to-flip-monsanto-the-bird-daily-13249799/">first appeared</a></i><br /><br /></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/stepoutsidethebox.html" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p1gLc-AkG_s/Tvi9JyyN1YI/AAAAAAAANjs/KmObDvyAPxo/s468/banner.gif" /></a></div></div></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/07/top-ways-to-flip-monsanto-bird-daily.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"noreply@blogger.com (Natural Blaze)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-07-17T07:13:17.313-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:92:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-umJnCBM05Nk/UeX3fxfAwwI/AAAAAAAAAWk/eai4XotJK78/s72-c/gmo-bird.png";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"11";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4446947302163364668.post-484372350649208757";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 15:58:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"bee colony collapse";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"natural-health-blog";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"natural-health-news";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"pesticides";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"Massive Bumblebee Die-Off Prompts Temporary Pesticide Ban in Oregon";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7158:"<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V89FLhVpNq4/UeVtgllmCZI/AAAAAAAARAc/dIWnRECwAJ8/s1600/Flickr-Dead-Bees-PetroleumJelliffe-300x225.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V89FLhVpNq4/UeVtgllmCZI/AAAAAAAARAc/dIWnRECwAJ8/s320/Flickr-Dead-Bees-PetroleumJelliffe-300x225.jpg" width="320" /></a>by Alex Pietrowski<br /><br />In what may be the single largest mass <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/08/07/now-that-we-know-who-killed-the-honey-bees-will-they-replace-them/">bumblebee die-off </a>on record, some 50,000 plus bees were recently found littering the parking lot of a Target store in Wilsonville, Oregon recently after a landscaping company sprayed surrounding trees with the insecticide Safari. Concerning shoppers and the community, the event also raised significant alarm amongst the Oregon Department of Agriculture, which has now enacted a temporary ban on the pesticide used in this incident, and for an additional 17 other insecticide products containing the chemical dinotefuran.<br /><br />Dinotefuran, a popular <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/02/26/who-will-save-the-honey-bee/">insecticide</a> found in agricultural, professional and household products is an insecticide of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid">neonicotinoid</a> class, a class of insecticides widely suspected to be the primary cause of the global bee and pollinator die-off we are witnessing today. <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/09/are-honey-bees-our-proverbial-canaries-in-the-coal-mine/">Neonicotinoids</a> include a number of other insecticides other than dinotefuran, and have for decades been suspected of being especially dangerous to bees:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Neonicotinoids are a relatively new class of insecticides that share a common mode of action that affect the central nervous system of insects, resulting in paralysis and death. They includeimidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, nithiazine, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam. According to the EPA, uncertainties have been identified since their initial registration regarding the potential environmental fate and effects of neonicotinoid pesticides, particularly as they relate to pollinators. Studies conducted in the late 1990s suggest that neonicotinic residues can accumulate in pollen and nectar of treated plants and represent a potential risk to pollinators.

Pesticides containing dinotefuran can no longer be used on plants, or at least not until the ban is lifted.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">ODA officials said they’re acting “in an abundance of caution” in issuing the ban. Director Katy Coba said she hopes the decision minimizes the potential for more bee deaths connected to pesticide products while the state continues to investigate and gather information. – <a href="http://www.kptv.com/story/22709592/pesticides-banned-following-bee-kills">Fox</a></blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organicfood.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TSVu1WxuKgI/AAAAAAAAFpA/qvqvHS98iwY/150x120-set1.gif" /></a>This is certainly encouraging news, yet oddly enough dinotefuran products and other neonicotinoids will still be available for sale in Oregon and only licensed <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/07/04/monsanto-paradise-how-stop-big-ag-from-destroying-hawaii/">pesticide applicators</a> will be liable in this ban.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“We’re not trying to get it off the shelves, or trying to tell people to dispose of it, we’re just telling people not to use it,” said Bruce Pokarney, a spokesperson for the department of agriculture.

The official speaking on the radio would not say. It would be difficult to come up with a worse time to deprive hundreds of thousands of people of life-giving water. Today’s heat index is expected to hit 105 degrees Fahrenheit! Similar heat indices are expected throughout the remaining week.<br /><br />According to the report, the problem is found in a “Fifty four inch main that is without redundancy.” Monitors indicate that the main is going to blow. It is believed by the water provider that allowing the main to blow and then performing the repair would mean the end user would be without water even longer and that the repair would be more expensive.<br /><br />How many of the people who will be affected by this water emergency will hear this warning? How many of those who do hear it will do so in time to act before the water is cut off and what little water is available in stores is gone?<br /><br />How many of the people who hear this warning in time will act?<br /><br />What should they do to prepare for a water emergency that will certainly last for days?<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>In heat like this each person needs two gallons of water per day. Having two gallons will provide at least a gallon for drinking and a little water for personal washing.<br /><br />The official in the interview said that the water emergency would last for, “days.” He would not elaborate further. Does that mean two days, five days, or thirty days?<br /><br />Let us suppose for the moment that the water emergency may go on for a as little as a week. Let us also suppose that we are planning for a family of four. Each person will need two gallons of water per day. Remember this only allows for drinking, cooking, and some personal washing. Never mind flushing the toilet, bathing, or washing clothes or dishes!<br /><br />Based on the bare minimum of two gallons per day, a family of four will require at least eight gallons of water per day. Just to provide drinking water for a family of four for one week you must set aside fifty six gallons of water – or just a little more than one fifty five gallon drum full of water. That will get you through ONE WEEK!<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/completesurvivalist.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LXdzaNwt00c/UPwnZ-oNLqI/AAAAAAAATmk/NPvZ64ppH6g/s200/banner-200x200-1.jpg" /></a>Unless of course you have <a href="http://barkingwindow.com/?p=5164">friends and family who are in need</a> and come to you for help…<br /><br />What will you do then?<br /><br />If you are selfish you will turn them away. If you are a little more thoughtful you will prepare something extra for those who may come begging when they realize that you have resources that they do not.<br /><br />If you are the thoughtful type you may well need to set aside twice what your family needs to offset the suffering of others!<br /><br />Storing water takes up a great deal of space – especially if you are the kind of person who thinks that buying cases upon cases of individual bottles in smart.<br /><br />Consider storing water in food-grade fifty five gallon drums. It will take up much less space! The up-front cost of buying food-grade drums can be expensive but it will be much less costly then purchasing cases of individual bottles. Another benefit that drives down the cost is that you can reuse the drums again and again. Two drums will store enough water to provide a family of four with drinking water for two weeks during a water emergency like the one about to occur in southern Prince George’s County. Four drums will provide that same family with drinking water for a month, or will ensure you have a little something to share with the ill prepared during a shorter emergency.<br /><br />Be mindful though – that much water is very heavy. Plan accordingly to prevent damage to your home. If possible keep it on the ground floor. It may also be a good idea to store barrels in separate areas to distribute weight.<br /><br />If you choose to use fifty five gallon drums you have the added benefit of having a drum or two to convert to rain barrels should the need arise.<br /><br />During an ongoing water emergency you will quickly find that life does not continue as we know it today. Due to a lack of water the washing machine will no longer clean your clothes. The dishwasher will no longer wash your dishes. Showers will no longer flow. Toilets will stop flushing!<br /><br />Your drinking water is only for drinking, cooking, and personal washing. That precious two gallons per day will not provide water for dirty dishes, laundry, or toilets.<br /><br />So what do you do?<br /><br />The hard facts are these: During an ongoing water emergency you will have to make serious changes in the way you deal with sanitation.<br /><br />Paper plates and plastic cups, and bowls purchased in bulk will help offset the need to wash dishes – at least in the short term.<br /><br />Hand sanitizer provides a means to clean dirty hands and frees up more water for drinking.<br /><br />You may find it necessary to wear your clothes longer between cleaning than you prefer. Hand wash under garments, using as little water and possible, will make life a bit more pleasant. Let the jeans and outer shirts go. During a water emergency (remember we are not talking about life as per usual here – this is an EMERGENCY and there is no water flowing from the tap) things will change – there simply won’t be enough water to live as we are accustomed.<br /><br />Whatever you do – do NOT use your drinking water for anything other than drinking, cooking, and a bit of personal washing!<br /><br />As for as bathroom habits go here are some tips:<br /><br />You need heavy duty garbage bags. Empty your toilet bowl of water then line the emptied bowl with the heavy-gauge plastic trash bag. Use the toilet this way. If you have kitty litter sprinkle a little over the contents of the bag after each use. Saw dust or even leaves are also good alternatives to kitty litter. Doing this helps keep the smell down. Replace the bag as needed. Do not wait until the bag is too heavy to manage or until it becomes so heavy it may burst! Place the bags of waste outside your home for trash pick up.<br /><br />I suggest listening to the radio for public service announcements. Your local government may have different or additional instructions for you to follow. If they do provide direction in this regard you should pay attention. If they do not that is just fine – you know how to proceed.<br /><br />Don’t forget hand sanitizer!<br /><br />When the water is off, cooking soups and stews (that are full of water) is a good idea.<br /><br />Drinking alcohol and soda is a bad idea. Both of these dehydrate.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/backyardliberty.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-B0KclVitUso/URWUioz-YII/AAAAAAAAUIg/4eat9_OafFI/s200/imgad3200.gif" /></a>During a water emergency dehydration is a much greater problem than normal. Be sure that everyone in your home is drinking plenty of water. The onset of diarrhea can quickly become an emergency. Be prepared with anti-diarrhea meds. If they don’t work – seek medical attention!<br /><br />Standing in a line made up of angry, desperate people with jugs, pans, and buckets waiting for your turn at a spigot at the back of a tanker truck is a terrible way to spend your time. If you prepare in advance for your and your family’s needs, the likelihood of you having to brave those desperate lines will be much lower.<br /><br />The math is simple: Two gallons of water for drinking, cooking, and a bit of personal washing – per person, per day is the absolute minimum you should plan for.<br /><br />Paper and plastic dishes will give you something to eat off of without having to use vital water resources for washing. Keep in mind though that this is a short-term solution.<br /><br />Set aside more water for cleaning undergarments – do not use your drinking water for this! Let your outer garments go.<br /><br />Heavy plastic bags (the strongest you can find) to line your toilet will allow the bathroom to continue to be used with only some inconvenience.<br /><br />Don’t forget to store – and use, hand sanitizer!<br /><br />We are all responsible for ourselves and for our families. This water emergency comes with a warning – most emergencies do not! Don’t count on the government, the community, or your neighbors to provide for you. Take action now so that your family need not fear a water emergency or any other emergency.<br /><br /><i>This article first appeared at <a href="http://barkingwindow.com/?p=8042">Barking Window</a><br /><br />Earl Griffin's site <a href="http://barkingwindow.com/">Barking Window</a> presents news that affects us all.

It appears that the non-smokers had more aggressive prostate cancer. It appears that non-drinkers, or people who drank less than one alcoholic drink at baseline, were at a higher risk of prostate cancer," MacKay noted.<br /><br />"So that just shows how carefully we have to deal with these sorts of statistical exercises where we take numbers from old studies and try to make heads or tails of that."<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/eatingforenergy.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NXBnYCOlwMY/UVM5JONZ6bI/AAAAAAAAUmY/Vf3sgEPfneI/s200/200-3.jpg" /></a>"If you listen to this study, you should not only cut omega-3 but you should start smoking cigarettes and drinking more."<br /><br /><b>Tiny changes with big effects?</b><br /><br />GOED commented that the difference in mean blood plasma phospholipid fatty acids level for omega-3s between the groups was small - 4.66% in the combined cancer group versus 4.48% in the control.<br /><br />"They are basing their results on just 0.2% difference in omega-3 levels."<br /><br />MacKay added that such a small difference in plasma omega-3 status between the top 'high-status' group and the bottom 'low-status' group was a major concern - especially given that both groups actually fall within the 'normal' range.<br /><br />"This change [of 0.2%] literally could have occurred if somebody ate a fish sandwich on their way to get their blood drawn," he said,<br /><br />"These levels are not astronomically high levels. Therefore any country that has a diet based on fish ... would have incredibly high levels of aggressive prostate cancer, and we know that's not the case."<br /><br />"It's a tiny and insignificant difference in plasma levels, which is linked to a 71% increase in cancer. And that's just a red flag."<br /><br /><b>Caution required</b><br /><br />Professor Gopinadhan Paliyath, from the University of Guelph, Canada, commented that the study 'must be dealt with caution' - adding that: "I have no idea how this paper got accepted for publication."<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text/Image */ google_ad_slot = "1104481866"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Among the first to respond to the study's findings, Alan Ruth, PhD, CEO of the Irish Health Trade Association, cited several large scale epidemiological studies, including those looking at native Japanese men, Inuit men. While Prof Paliyath noted that similar findings have been seen in men that live in coastal regions of South India.<br /><br />All of these studies, he noted, have shown that a high intake of fish and a high omega-3 status is linked to a lower incidence of many cancers - including prostate cancer.<br /><br />"In a 2010 meta-analysis of 31 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the risks of prostate cancer diagnosis calculated for high fish consumption ranged from a 61% decrease in risk to a 77% increase in risk, and several showed no significant differences in risk at all," said Dr Ruth.<br /><br />"In the same meta-analysis, pooled data from four studies on fish consumption and death from prostate cancer (rather than diagnosis of prostate cancer) found a 63% decrease in risk for high fish consumption."<br /><br />"This study linking high blood concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids to an increased risk of prostate cancer should not discourage health conscious men from taking omega-3 supplements," he added.<br /><br /><i><a href="http://preventdisease.com/">Mae Chan</a> holds degrees in both physiology and nutritional sciences.

It’s not very expensive, it’s simple, and once you’ve made one kind of jam, others just cooperatively fall into place for you.  It’s a great way to get started canning.<br /><br />The instructions for basic jams are all pretty much the same – you only need to make minor modifications for different fruits.  So, because we’re all creative people, I’m laying out the basic how-to, giving you a chart with special instructions fruit by fruit, and you can take it from there.<br /><i><br /></i> <i>Ingredients</i><br /><ul><li>8 cups of fresh or frozen fruit</li><li>1 packet of pectin + ¼ of a package (I like to use the no-sugar-needed, but then still add sugar – just less!)</li><li>4 cups of sugar</li></ul><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><i>Directions</i><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">1. Prep your fruit by washing it and cutting it up if necessary.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">2. Smush your fruit.  You can do this with a potato masher, food processer, blender or food mill.  For some fruits I like to puree them and have a smoother jam and for others I like chunkier jam – it’s up to personal preference.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">3. In a small bowl, use a fork to mix ¼ cup of the sugar with one packet of pectin.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">4. In a saucepan, stir the fruit, lemon juice and pectin together well.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">5. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">6. Once it is boiling, stir in the sugar and return to a boil for one minute.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">7. This is important:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><b>Jam Making Rule of Law:&nbsp;Always test your jam!!!!&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">How?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">You do this by keeping a spoon in the freezer – to test, drip a bit of the hot jam into the spoon to allow it to quick cool – the consistency it reaches is the consistency your finished product will be.  At this point, I nearly always end up adding another 1/4 – 1/2 package of pectin – I use the cheaper pectin to “top it up” – return to a simmer for a couple of minutes and test again.   Omitting this step may result in a very tasty ice cream topping or waffle syrup, but not jam!&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">8. Ladle the jam carefully into your awaiting (<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012">sanitized</a>) jars, wipe the rim and cap your jars with snap lids and rings.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">9.

Investors in the manufacture, distribution and administration of vaccines have reaped handsome rewards since the creation of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA).<br /><br />According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/history.html">Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The topic of vaccine safety became prominent during the mid 1970s with increases in lawsuits filed on behalf of those presumably injured by the diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) vaccine. Legal decisions were made and damages awarded despite the lack of scientific evidence to support vaccine injury claims. As a result of these decisions, liability and prices soared, and several manufacturers halted production. A vaccine shortage resulted and public health officials became concerned about the return of epidemic disease. To reduce liability and respond to public health concerns, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986.</blockquote><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>This change in liability created an environment where vaccine manufacturers could evolve from threatening to get out of the vaccine production business to generating the following sales in 2012:(1)<br /><ol><li>Prevnar 13® – $3.718 billion – Pfizer</li><li>Gardasil® – $1.900 billion – Merck &amp; Co/Sanofli Pasteur MSD</li><li>PENTAct-HIB – $1.522 billion – Sanofli/Sanofli Pasteur MSD</li><li>Infanrix/Pediarix – $1.183 billion – by GlaxoSmithKline</li><li>Fluzone – $1.152 billion – by Sanofli/Sanofli Pasteur MSD</li><li>Hepatitis franchise – $986 million – by GlaxoSmithKline</li><li>Varivax – $846 million – by Merck &amp; Co/Sanofli Pasteur MSD</li><li>Menactra – $735 million – by Sanofli/Sanofli Pasteur</li><li>Zostavax – $651 million – by Merck &amp; Co/Sanofli Pasteur</li><li>RotaTeq® – $648 million – by Merck &amp; Co/Sanofli Pasteur</li><li>Synflorix® – $587 million – by GlaxoSmithKline</li><li>Pneumovax®23 – $580 million – by Merck &amp; Co/Sanofli Pasteur</li><li>Rotarix – $549 million – by GlaxoSmithKline</li><li>Adacel – $469 million – by Sanofli/Sanofli Pasteur MSD</li><li>Prevnar – $399 million – by Pfizer</li></ol>For the five producers of the top 15 vaccines, this is a total of $15.925 billion; not at all bad for an industry that was threatening to close down operations 30 years ago. Apparently, limited liability does wonders for the bottom line.<br /><br />Whether the miraculous nature of the limited liability vaccination programs instituted since the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created extends to safety and efficacy remains hotly debated.<br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/vaccineexempt.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8n0lSATEOvA/UHClnvZ78iI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_hdaYp5kbtA/s250/legal-vaccine.jpg" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" /></a>For instance, in 1980 there were three recommended vaccines given in five shots before age 2; DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis), MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) and OPV (oral polio vaccine).

After so many poor seasons in a row, the heavy rain we've been having was breathing new life into the fields. In Michigan, we had over a week of daily rain. Our thanks (and funky rain dances) quickly turned sour as some of our friends' gardens were flooded, sometimes for days, ruining whole sections of carefully tended plants. In our discussion of plans for next year we went over a few ideas to hopefully prevent this in the future.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Raised Beds</b><br /><b><br /></b> Always a personal favorite, raised beds create the perfect opportunity to tailor your garden specifically to your climate and landscape. One of the best methods of raised bed gardening revisits our old friend, <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/04/hugelkultur-natural-permaculture.html">hugelkultur</a>, or mound gardening. While hugelkultur beds can be created by digging and laying logs or wood chips below the surface, generally the soil is piled on top of the wood, creating an effective raised bed. This allows the water to run downhill while the underlying wood aids in preventing erosion, and at the same time traps water near the roots of the plants for later use. Even building garden boxes allows for more effective use of natural water, without drowning your plants in natural low areas where the water has no means of escape.<br /><br /><b>Location, Location, Location</b><br /><b><br /></b> <a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/organicfood.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TSVu1WxuKgI/AAAAAAAAFpA/qvqvHS98iwY/150x120-set1.gif" /></a>Careful planning is what natural gardening is all about. Using the lay of the land and planning your garden accordingly can save a multitude of headaches in the future. If your yard presents natural hillsides, use these to your advantage. Planting on top of a hill can expose your garden to wind damage, lack of water, and soil erosion. Plant too low and you might find yourself with a pleasant amphibian pond. Utilizing the hillside is generally the best way to ensure good growth. A gentle slope facing solar south will ensure your future food gets plenty of sunlight, downhill runoff and protection from wind and flooding. Of course, the natural layout of your property won't always be perfect. Perhaps the hills are too steep, or non existent. There are still options.<br /><br /><b>Terracing</b><br /><b><br /></b> This nifty concept has been in practice for hundreds, if not thousands of years. A simple search for 'terrace farming' will turn up amazing photographs of farms all over the world carved into mountains and hillsides. In areas where most of us would be afraid to walk (OK, mostly me...I don't get along with heights) farmers are managing to sustain successful yields by simply modifying certain aspects of the terrain. Terracing and contour farming are excellent for preserving nutrients in the soil, and allowing planting on areas that would otherwise be too difficult to work. Obviously most of us will be operating on a much smaller scale the the image below, but the effectiveness would be the same.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--mp5AwieAWg/UeIwrprsvII/AAAAAAAAAWU/8l28nwqXLhI/s1600/Terrace_farming_on_the_way_to_Ransi_village,_Garhwal,_Uttarakhand.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="" border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--mp5AwieAWg/UeIwrprsvII/AAAAAAAAAWU/8l28nwqXLhI/s320/Terrace_farming_on_the_way_to_Ransi_village,_Garhwal,_Uttarakhand.jpg" title="By Varun Shiv Kapur " width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yeah...No Thanks.</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Mulch</b><br /><b><br /></b> Placing mulch in your garden has a variety of benefits, from the moisture-saving layers of a hugelkultur bed to displacing weeds and certain types of insects. A light mulch layer has the added benefit of protecting the soil from heavy rains. Plants that are just beginning to break the surface can be hammered and washed away by an over-enthusiastic cloudburst. Laying some mulch may give the plants the initial protection they need until their roots are strong enough to hold them in place.<br /><br /><b>Trenches</b><br /><b><br /></b> And ponds. Creating a system of drainage ditches can work both by directing water to the areas of your garden that need it, and draining excess water away from areas that tend to pool.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text/Image */ google_ad_slot = "1104481866"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>Greenhouses</b><br /><b><br /></b> Create the perfect micro ecosystem in the safety of your own backyard. Well, maybe not perfect, but once set up, a greenhouse can be a cozy little maternity ward for your sprouts. Temperature-controlled, enclosed , insect-repelling...OK, maybe it is almost perfect. But we don't all have the space or the money for a greenhouse in the backyard, so planning your garden topography in advance might be the way to go if excessive puddle accumulation has you down. Don't know where to dig? You might want to consider enlisting the help of a permaculture design expert, or even spending a few hours asking around your local farmers' market. The odds of finding someone with similar experience will be a lot higher in your local area and you might just find someone willing to help you design a plot that's just right for your needs.<br /><br /><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><b><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/jonathan-parker" style="border: 0px none; color: #00aa4f; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: none 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Jonathan Parker</a></b>&nbsp;is an EMT-Paramedic and Preparedness Instructor with a love for emergency medicine, self-sufficiency and homesteading.

The treatment group received two capsules of FTP three times a day after meals, for 12 weeks.<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><b>What were the results?</b><br /><br />Not only did FTP significantly reduce ALT levels in subjects but also reduced serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), two additional enzymes which when elevated are commonly associated with liver damage. The effects were maintained as long as the subjects remained on the treatment. Also, FTP was well tolerated and without significant adverse effects.<br /><br />This study adds additional weight to a rather vast body of preclinical research that has accumulated over the past two decades confirming turmeric and its primary polyphenol curcumin's liver protecting properties.  The GreenMedInfo.com database now contains 86 studies demonstrating the ability of turmeric (and curcumin) to protect the liver against a wide range of chemical and drug exposures.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-turmeric-may-be-diseased-livers-best-friend-friend-a#_ftn2">[2]</a>We recently featured a study published in the <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/curcumin-treatment-beneficially-repaired-and-regenerated-liver-tissues"><i>Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand</i></a> which revealed the potential of turmeric to protect and <b>regenerate </b>the diabetic liver.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-turmeric-may-be-diseased-livers-best-friend-friend-a#_ftn3">[3]</a><br /><br /><b>Turmeric May Also Kill Liver Cancer</b><br /><br /><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oBYhzykle4E/UF4PWSOj_EI/AAAAAAAARz8/IxYhUqLJB9M/s220/200.jpg" /></a>What may be even more remarkable is the accumulating research on the anti-liver cancer properties of turmeric (and curcumin).

A 2001 study in cancer patients reported that quantities of curcumin up to 8 g, administered per day for three months, were not toxic and resulted in significant anti-cancer properties in a number of those treated.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-turmeric-may-be-diseased-livers-best-friend-friend-a#_ftn5">[5]</a> Considering that turmeric is only 3-4% curcumin by weight, this implies that a larger quantity of turmeric can be consumed safely, as well.<br /><br />Of course, while these results are promising, the real solution to elevated liver enzymes is to identify the underlying causes, e.g. infection, NSAID use, chemical exposures, dietary intolerances, etc., and remove them.  Failing that, those within the integrative medical field who are looking for evidence-based ways to address the sometimes inevitable hepatotoxicity of standard drug-based treatments may find a role for turmeric (curcumin) in their practices.  Other folks, simply looking for ways to improve their health and to prevent liver problems may wish to consume smaller doses through incorporating the spice (which must be organic to avoid the dangers of irradiation) into traditional recipes at culinary doses.

Instead of causing far more side effects than therapeutic ones, as is the case for most patented pharmaceutical medications, turmeric possesses hundreds of potential side benefits, having been empirically demonstrated to positively modulate over 160 different physiological pathways in the mammalian body.<br /><br />While no food or herb is right for everyone, and everything has the potential for unintended, adverse side effects, turmeric is truly unique in its exceptionally high margin of safety vis-à-vis the drugs it has been compared with, e.g. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/curcumin-has-similar-effect-hydrocortisone-preventing-bleomycin-induced-pulmonary-fibrosis">hydrocortisone</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/turmeric-extract-appears-be-safe-and-effective-ibuprofen-treatment-knee-osteoarthritis">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/chemotherapy-induced-toxicity">chemotherapy agents</a>. Furthermore, nothing within the modern-day pharmaceutical armamentarium comes even remotely close to turmeric's 6,000 year track record of safe use in Ayurvedic medicine.<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/600-reasons-turmeric-may-be-worlds-most-important-herb#_ftn1">[1]</a><br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>Despite its vast potential for alleviating human suffering, turmeric will likely never receive the FDA stamp of approval, due to its lack of exclusivity, patentability and therefore profitability. Truth be told, the FDA's "gold standard" for proving the value of a prospective medicinal substance betrays the age old aphorism: "he who owns the gold makes the rules," and unless an investor is willing to risk losing the 800+ million dollars that must be spent upfront, the FDA-required multi-phased double-blind, randomized clinical trials will not occur. For additional details on this rather seedy arrangement read our article on the topic: <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-law-forbids-medicinal-use-natural-substances">Why The Law Forbids The Medicinal Use of Natural Substances</a>.<br /><br />Here at GreenMedInfo.com, we have reviewed over 5,000 study abstracts from the National Library of Medicine's bibliographic database known as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">MEDLINE</a> and have discovered over 600 potential health benefits of turmeric, and/or its primary polyphenol known as <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/curcumin">curcumin</a>. These can be viewed on our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/turmeric">turmeric research</a> page which is dedicated to disseminating the research on the topic to a larger audience.<br /><br />Some of the most amazing demonstrated properties include:<br /><ul><li>Destroying <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/cancers-multi-drug-resistant">Multi-Drug Resistant Cancer</a></li><li>Destroying Cancer Stem Cells (arguably, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/are-cancer-stem-cells-key-discovering-cure">the root of all cancer</a>)</li><li>Protecting Against <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/radiation-induced-illness">Radiation-Induced Damage</a></li><li>Reducing Unhealthy Levels of Inflammation</li><li>Protecting Against <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/heavy-metal-toxicity">Heavy Metal Toxicity</a></li><li>Preventing and Reversing <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/research-foodsspices-slow-perhaps-reverse-alzheimers">Alzheimer's Disease</a> Associated Pathologies</li></ul>Again, what is so amazing is not that turmeric may have value in dozens of health conditions simultaneously, or that it may improve conditions that are completely resistant to conventional treatment, but that there are over six hundred additional health conditions it may also be valuable in preventing and/or treating. Consider also the fact that turmeric grows freely on the Earth, and you will understand why its very existence threatens billions of dollars in pharmaceutical industry revenue.  <br /><br />Learn more about this research in the video below (keeping in mind that it is several years old and needing some updating), and please spread the information to others who may benefit from learning more on the topic.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="370" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s2AZOMu0bVA?feature=player_embedded" width="565"></iframe> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/600-reasons-turmeric-may-be-worlds-most-important-herb#_ftnref1">[1]</a> The Genus Curcuma (Medicinal and Aromatic Plants - Industrial Profiles); CRC; March 2007<br /><br /><i>Article originally posted at <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/600-reasons-turmeric-may-be-worlds-most-important-herb">GreenMedInfo</a></i><br /><br />Sayer Ji is an author, researcher, lecturer, and advisory board member of the <a href="http://www.thenhf.com/">National Health Federation</a>.<br /><br />He founded Greenmedinfo.com in 2008 in order to provide the world an open access, evidence-based resource supporting natural and integrative modalities.

The same exact issue happens in the U.S. with <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/03/conventional-doctors-now-standing.html" target="_blank">doctors groups standing up against the trend.</a> Their fear is that Ritalin is prescribed out of expediency and convenience in lieu of more expensive, time-taking options like counseling (and overall health).<br /><br />Recently, child psychologists gathered at a summit in Manchester to discuss the rising “medicalization of childhood.” Ritalin – methylphenidate hydrochloride – is considered safe by allopathic standards and time-tested, but is a serious drug with the ability to cause nausea, mood swings, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, heart problems,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682188.html" target="_blank">heart attacks</a> and is <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2141044/ADHD-Ritalin-prescriptions-soaring-experts-warn-effects.html" target="_blank">linked to suicide</a>. It is considered comparably safe to hardcore self-medicating like alcohol (think: quick dopamine shot), cocaine, and Speed. But for kids?? Three-year-olds??<br /><br /><div align="center"><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client = "ca-pub-1897954795849722"; /* NAT-468x60-Text */ google_ad_slot = "5478282661"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; </script><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>The education and child psychology department of the British Psychological Society pointed out a nine-fold increase ADHD prescriptions for children. According to the NHS, in 1997, there were around 92,000 prescriptions. Compare that to nearly 800,000 prescriptions last year! This is only in the UK - the U.S. is a different story.&nbsp;Over here, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/04/radical-increase-in-kids-prescribed-ritalin/" target="_blank">sales</a> of ADHD stimulants more than doubled between 2007 and 2012, from $4 billion to $9 billio<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">n.&nbsp;</span>England's and Wales’ own guidelines recommend a “comprehensive” program to help struggling children such as counseling and educational tools, among others.<br /><br />Vivian Hill, chairperson of the BPS, finds that a comprehensive program does not always come into play. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Budgets have been cut and psychiatrists feel they can’t follow the official guidelines, which recommend therapy before drugs.</blockquote>Often, the first response now is to issue drugs, not offer therapeutic help.<br /><br />She estimated that hundreds of children under age six are given ADHD drugs, and that the drugs are of no use absent other support. A study last year by the Association of Educational Psychologists backed Hill's claim. The study found that more than one hundred children under age six were in fact prescribed drugs like Ritalin, in just one locale, and affirmed the trend was more than regional.<br /><br />A spokesperson from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence believes that drugs have a small role compared to psychotherapy for ADHD management. <br /><br />He said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">These drugs are not recommended as first-line treatments for young people with mild or moderate ADHD. They are recommended as first-line therapy for school-age children and young people with severe ADHD.</blockquote><a href="http://products.naturalblaze.com/superfoods.html" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" class="noshadow" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N2GOFRKd8Vs/UF4PWWZ5dsI/AAAAAAAARz4/tuwcrewmlWA/s316/herbalcures.png" style="background-image: none; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: none;" width="160" /></a>A Cambridge professor echoed the thought believing that most cases weren’t severe enough for drugs and that therapeutic tools could suffice, saying:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">But the parents are quite keen they should have a drug. Parents know these drugs are cognitive enhancing, so I guess they’re trying to get an advantage for the child.</blockquote>On a personal note, I observe that it is much more difficult for adults to obtain ADHD drugs than children, with the exception of the increase of middle-aged women on ADHD meds. Working at a school, one of my jobs was to dole out this medication, and it filled me with dread. They were on the highest dosage, 20mg, and some took it multiple times. Out of desperation and haste for my own struggles, I sought help for ADHD and was treated like an addict. <br /><br />I’ve lost jobs for the way that I think and function and thought there was “something wrong with me.” I didn’t know in my early 20s that there <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/is-adhd-evolutionary-gift-in-rapidly.html" target="_blank">really wasn’t anything inherently wrong</a> (maybe a wrong job fit) and that nutrition and homeopathy are just a couple ways to excel. After getting diagnosed three times with ADHD, all the psychiatrists and doctors wanted was for me to go to anti-depressants, without even taking time to study the issues. I thought that would be disastrous. <br /><br />When I finally proved that I needed it and was healthy enough to take it, the initial results on the lowest dosage, 5mg, were astounding (like in the movie <i>Limitless</i>) – but just like that movie, they didn’t last and there was a price to pay. An increase in just 5mg once more during the day helped a bit but led to serious heart issues, sometimes pain and numbness. I lost the desire to eat and the ability to sleep even after quitting them. So it is baffling that 20mg can be given to little children – and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that every year, some of them die from heart attacks.<br /><br />Drugs like Ritalin take up dopamine receptor sites that then weaken the brain’s ability to produce dopamine on its own. Thus, crippling dependency and continued “self-medicating.” It creates a debt in the body that is difficult to overcome. Even though the man who first labeled ADHD <a href="http://dcclothesline.com/2013/05/25/father-of-adhd-admitted-in-final-interview-that-disease-was-fictitious/" target="_blank">later said it was fake,</a> does not make the symptoms any less real to those who struggle with what feels like an insurmountable burden. There are a variety of promising and even inexpensive ways to approach ADHD-like symptomology that add to one’s life if one takes some time to look.<br /><br />*ADHD: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Note: recently both types, non-attentive and hyperactive were rolled into one acronym, ADHD. General modern consensus finds that it is not a deficit of attention, but more so an inability to concentrate among other keynotes.<br /><br /><i>Image: Wikimedia Commons</i><br /><br /><b>Source:</b><br /><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2351427/Number-children-given-drugs-ADHD-ninefold-patients-young-THREE-prescribed-Ritalin.html#ixzz2YUd0A4TO">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2351427/Number-children-given-drugs-ADHD-ninefold-patients-young-THREE-prescribed-Ritalin.html#ixzz2YUd0A4TO</a><br /><br /><i><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/Heather-Callaghan">Heather Callaghan</a> is a natural health blogger and food freedom activist.
