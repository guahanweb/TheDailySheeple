<p>White House officials say the United States may launch a limited military strike on Syria as early as this Thursday as the intelligence community prepares to release a report justifying action and allies are rallied.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note: be sure to read my latest story on Syria, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/u-s-warships-poised-to-strike-syria-as-obama-weighs-options-russia-warns-of-catastrophe-and-syria-of-chaos/" target="_blank">U.S. warships poised to strike Syria as Obama weighs options, Russia warns of ‘catastrophe’ and Syria of ‘chaos’</a>&#8221; along with the latest on that from Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/27/us-military-ready-to-go-if-syria-attack-ordered/" target="_blank">US military ‘ready to go’ if Syria attack ordered</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Senior officials in the Obama administration told the Washington Post for an article published on Tuesday that the White House is weighing a limited strike on Syria and said on condition of anonymity that “<i>We’re actively looking at the various legal angles that would inform a decision</i>.”</p>
<p>According to the Post, the likely response from Washington would be a sea-to-land strike from the Mediterranean that would last no longer than two days and would not be directed towards targets where the chemical weapons arsenal is believed to be stored.</p>
<p>But while an attack is all but imminent and will likely be launched from warships already mobilized in the Mediterranean by the week’s end, public support in the US has teetered towards nil as of late. The Obama administration says there is undeniable proof that chemical weapons were used on civilians outside of Damascus on August 21, but a five-day-long Reuters poll taken during that time concluded only nine percent of Americans favor intervention.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that lack of support, US Secretary of State John Kerry <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rt.com/usa/kerry-syria-chemical-attack-017/" target="_blank">hinted</a> Monday at a response which will jolt Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ideally worsen the odds that his regime will implement chemical warheads again.</p>
<p>Despite insistence from Assad and allies in Russia that the Syrian government is not guilty of using chemical weapons, Sec. Kerry said during a press conference on Monday that “<i>our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscious and guided by common sense</i>.” Kerry called Assad’s reported attempt to cover-up the alleged use of chemical weapons “<i>cynical</i>” and said, “<i>President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people</i>.”</p>
<p>One day earlier, Sec. Kerry admitted that Pres. Obama was considering his options with regards to a strike and was to meet with lawmakers in Congress as well as with international leaders. According to the Post article, however, the president may forego getting approval from Capitol Hill and will instead rely on striking Syria due to “<i>undeniable</i>,” as the White House puts it, war crimes.</p>
<p>“<i>The administration has said that it will follow international law in shaping its response</i>,” Karen DeYoung and Anne Gearan wrote for the Post, adding, “<i>But much of international law is untested, and administration lawyers are also examining possible legal justifications based on a violation of international prohibitions on chemical weapons use, or on an appeal for assistance from a neighboring nation such as Turkey</i>.” Additionally, the US has already received assurance of support from Britain, France and Turkey.</p>

<p>According to senior administration officials who spoke to CBS News on condition of anonymity, Pres. Obama met with his national security team this past weekend and has ordered that a declassified intelligence report showing the rationale for any attack on Syria be released before it occurs.</p>
<p>While only nine percent of the respondents polled in the Reuters survey between August 19 and 23 said they want the White House to respond to Assad’s reported use of chemical weapons immediately, 25 percent said they would favor intervention if the US concludes with certainty that those warheads were illegally used. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from earlier in the month found that 30.2 percent of Americans would support intervention if Assad is linked to using chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Sec. Kerry said the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children apparently being carried out by the Assad regime constitutes a “<i>moral obscenity</i>.”</p>

<p>The US military have moved up their assets and are ready to take any action on Syria ordered by President Obama, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Tuesday, amid building international pressure over last week’s alleged chemical attack near Damascus.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note: be sure to read my latest story on Syria, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/u-s-warships-poised-to-strike-syria-as-obama-weighs-options-russia-warns-of-catastrophe-and-syria-of-chaos/" target="_blank">U.S. warships poised to strike Syria as Obama weighs options, Russia warns of ‘catastrophe’ and Syria of ‘chaos’</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><i>“We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take,”</i> Hagel told the BBC in an interview.</p>
<p>Hagel added that there were a range of options available, from doing nothing to a limited cruise missile strike, or to boots on the ground – in the style of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>Should the order be given, US forces were <i>“ready to go, like that,”</i> he said.</p>
<p>However, a senior US administration official said Tuesday that Obama has made no decision to take military action against the Syrian government.</p>
<p>The Defense Secretary pointed out no decision would be made until more facts had been gathered about the alleged chemical weapons attack, which killed anywhere from dozens to 1,300 people in Syria last week.</p>
<p>Hagel said he believed it was <i>“pretty clear chemical weapons had been used in Syria”</i> and that intelligence would prove that it wasn’t the rebels who used them.</p>
<p><i>“It’s clear that the government of Syria was responsible,”</i> he said.</p>
<p>When asked what he thought about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s comments that any attack on Syria would breach international law, Hagel indicated that he didn’t think a UN resolution would be sought and that no nation <i>“is bound by only one dimension of whether they make a decision to respond to the kind of humanitarian violations we saw in Syria.” </i></p>
<p>He denied that the US was now duty bound to launch a strike on Syria, after Obama’s comments earlier this year that Assad would cross a <i>“red line”</i> if he used chemical weapons.</p>

<p><i>“Let’s get the facts, let’s get the intelligence and then a decision will be made on whether caution should be taken, what action or no action.” </i></p>
<p>Hagel’s comments come after US Secretary of State John Kerry appeared to lay the groundwork for military action, saying that Obama believed there needed to be <i>“accountability”</i> for the use of chemical weapons.</p>
<p>A US official said that any military strikes could be launched <i>“as early as Thursday”</i>, it was reported in the US media.</p>
<p>The official added that <i>“three days”</i> of strikes would be limited in scope and would be aimed at sending a message to the regime of President Bashar Assad.</p>
<h2>Military action in Syria ‘within days’ – sources</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the prospect of military action against Syria appeared to come a step closer after western powers told a meeting with Syrian opposition envoys that they should expect a strike against President Assad’s forces within days, sources revealed to Reuters.</p>
<p>The meeting was at a hotel in Istanbul was between senior figures of the Syrian National Coalition, including president Ahmad Jarba and envoys of countries comprising “Friends of Syria” group, which included Robert Ford, the top US official handling Syria.</p>
<p><i>“The opposition was told in clear terms that action to deter further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime could come as early as in the next few days, and they should prepare for peace talks in Geneva,”</i> the source said.</p>
<p>UN weapons inspectors trying to determine what happened during last week’s attack were able to access the area to talk to survivors despite being shot at while traveling in government-controlled territory Monday. They put off a second visit until Wednesday.</p>
<p>Western powers have faced Russian and Chinese disapproval of nay potential military action in Syria, which could dampen the chance of proposed peace talks in Geneva.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated Monday that the fallout from the alleged chemical attack was aimed at stalling the proposed Geneva peace talks. <i>“The opposition does obviously not want to negotiate peacefully,”</i> Lavrov said.</p>
<p>Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said in a phone call to Cameron on Monday that he <i>“did not have any evidence of whether a chemical weapons attack had taken place and who was responsible.”</i></p>

<p dir="ltr">Both the<a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/23/us-readies-possible-missile-strike-against-syria-report/" target="_blank"> United States</a> and<a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/uk-gathers-warplanes-military-hardware-in-cyprus-base-near-syria-report/" target="_blank"> United Kingdom have placed military hardware near Syria</a> in anticipation of a possible upcoming strike which is looking increasingly likely after<a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/us-accuses-syrian-government-of-using-chemical-weapons-and-destroying-evidence/" target="_blank"> Secretary of State John Kerry’s statements earlier Monday</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a Western military attack on Syria would only result in more problems in the region and lead to more bloodshed, according to<em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/russia-says-western-attack-on-syria-would-be-catastrophic/2013/08/26/4a7ea122-0e5d-11e3-a2b3-5e107edf9897_story.html" target="_blank"> The Washington Post</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lavrov also said that an attack would be the same kind of “catastrophe” as the interventions in Iraq and Libya, while a senior Syrian official said that they will defend itself against any international attack, according to<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57600101/fearing-a-u.s-strike-syria-warns-of-global-chaos/" target="_blank"> CBS News</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mikdad told the Associated Press that airstrikes or other military action would not only trigger “chaos” and would also threaten peace and security worldwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, officials in Washington are assessing their various options for an attack which would “probably last no more than two days and involve sea-launched cruise missiles — or, possibly, long-range bombers — striking military targets not directly related to Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal,” according to<em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kerry-obama-determined-to-hold-syria-accountable-for-using-chemical-weapons/2013/08/26/599450c2-0e70-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html" target="_blank"> The Washington Post</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The factors reportedly involved in the decision are:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1.      The findings of a yet-to-be-completed intelligence report evaluating any culpability on the part of the Syrian government in the<a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/21/russia-suggests-syria-chemical-attack-carried-out-by-rebels-provocation-not-ruled-out/" target="_blank"> alleged chemical attack last week</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">2.      Consultation with allied nations and Congress, both of which are ongoing</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.      The determination of a justification for the strike under international law</p>
<p dir="ltr">In his statements, Kerry said that the UN investigation of the chemical attack isn’t informing their current statements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kerry noted that although the UN investigators continue to gather “additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have additional information about this attack, and that information is being compiled and reviewed together with our partners, and we will provide that information in the days ahead,” Kerry said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <em>Post</em> summed up Kerry’s statement as “part of an escalating administration drumbeat, which is likely to include a public statement by Obama in coming days.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">CBS News speaks of the strike in Syria as a certainty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Any final decisions haven&#8217;t been made, but senior administration officials talk of Syria now as a place where the U.S. and its allies must exact a military price for heavy use of chemical weapons,” CBS reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) expects that a “response” – which most likely means a military strike – is imminent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think a response is imminent. I talked last evening in the situation room and we’re building support with NATO allies,” Corker said on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/syria-response-bob-corker-95899.html" target="_blank">Monday morning</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Russia is currently one of the greatest obstacles in the way of Western intervention and a significant Syrian ally, Saudi Arabia is attempting to make that change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Russia backs away from Assad, Saudi Arabia reportedly offered a secret deal “to control the global oil market and safeguard Russia’s gas contracts,” according to<em><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/saudis-offer-russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-syria-20130827-2smvt.html" target="_blank"> The Sydney Morning Herald</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leaked transcripts of a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan revealed a quite disturbing conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bandar allegedly promised to protect Russia’s<a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/11/18/russian-warships-entering-syrian-waters-to-inhibit-foreign-invasion-as-opposition-calls-for-no-fly-zone/" target="_blank"> naval base in Syria</a> if the Assad government falls and also protect the Sochi Olympics if they agree to a deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the Games are controlled by us,” Prince Bandar allegedly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We use them in the face of the Syrian regime but they will have no role in Syria’s political future,” he reportedly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this is accurate, it is a quite amazing, though not all that surprising, statement. It remains to be seen if Russia will back away from Syria in the coming days. For now, they seem to be standing behind Assad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Putin reportedly told British Prime Minister David Cameron<a href="http://rt.com/news/putin-cameron-syria-attack-020/" target="_blank"> earlier Monday</a> that there is no evidence that Assad’s forces were behind the alleged chemical attack.</p>
<p>If Russia suddenly stops opposing Western intervention in Syria, the<a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/01/13/foreign-syrian-intervention-and-the-russian-chinese-opposition/" target="_blank"> last real obstacle would be removed</a>.</p>

<p>Two commercial pilots who regularly fly from Larnaca, Cyprus, claim to have spotted C-130 transport planes from their own aircraft and small formations of possibly European fighter jets from their radar screens, according to the Guardian.</p>
<p>Akrotiri airbase is less than 100 miles from Syria, making it a likely hub for a bombing campaign. Residents near the airfield confirmed to the Guardian that <i>“activity there has been much higher than normal over the past 48 hours.”</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, top military officials from ten Western and Middle Eastern nations – led by US Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and his Jordanian counterpart – met in Amman, Jordan, to discuss potential military action in Syria. This follows reports that Dempsey presented potential military options to the White House over the weekend.</p>
<p>On Friday, Reuters revealed the US Navy was expanding its Mediterranean presence with a fourth ship capable launching long-range, subsonic cruise missiles to reach land targets in Syria.</p>

<p>British military assets already near Syria include four warships, the Navy&#8217;s flagship HMS Bulwark, a helicopter carrier and two frigates near Albania. Meanwhile France – another key player in the possible conflict – has its jet fighters stationed in the United Arab Emirates if needed</p>
<p>The Obama administration has little doubt the regime of Assad deployed chemical weapons on the outskirts of Damascus last week, killing hundreds, US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday.</p>
<p>Reports from Syria of chemical warfare <i>“should shock the conscience of the world,”</i> Kerry said, adding that the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children carried out by the Assad regime constitutes a <i>“moral obscenity.”</i></p>
<p>President Barack Obama has yet to make a determination about how the US will respond, Kerry said, but a decision would be forthcoming.</p>
<p><i>“While investigators are gathering additional information on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscious and guided by common sense,”</i> Sec. Kerry said. <i>“The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the first-hand accounts from the humanitarian organizations on the ground &#8230; these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us are real: that chemical weapons were used in Syria.”</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday during a phone call with British Prime Minister David Cameron that there is no evidence such an attack had occurred. <i>“President Putin said that they did not have evidence of whether a chemical weapons attack had taken place or who was responsible,”</i> a British government spokesperson said after the meeting.</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed during an emergency press conference in Moscow that the US, Britain and other countries have assembled a <i>“powerful force”</i> and are <i>“readying their ships and planes”</i> for a possible invasion in Syria.</p>

<p><i>“Official Washington, London and Paris say they have incontrovertible evidence that the Syrian government is behind the chemical attack in Damascus, but they have not yet presented this evidence,”</i> Lavrov said, expressing particular outrage with the newly introduced possibility of NATO staging a strike on Syria without a United Nations mandate.</p>
<p>UN investigators were in the Damascus area Monday, taking samples from the site of Wednesday’s alleged chemical attack in an eastern suburb. The UN team was quickly forced to return to the government checkpoint to replace their car, which <i>“was deliberately shot at multiple times by unidentified snipers in the buffer zone area,&#8221;</i> a spokesman for the UN secretary-general, Martin Nesirky, said.</p>
<p>The United Nations assured that it was still possible for the team of experts to gather necessary evidence despite the time elapsed since the alleged attack. Ban Ki-moon added that the UN will <i>“register a strong complaint”</i> to both the Syrian government and opposition forces as a result of the attack in an effort to stem future aggression against investigation teams.</p>
<p>Back in Washington, White House press Secretary Jay Carney weighed in with a statement of his own Monday, saying use of chemical weapons on a widespread scale outside of Damascus on August 21 was <i>&#8220;undeniable.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>“As Ban Ki-moon said last week, the UN investigation will not determine who used these chemical weapons, only whether such weapons were used – a judgment that is already clear to the world,&#8221;</i> Carney said, adding that it is <i>“profoundly in the interest of the United States and the international community that that violation of an international norm be responded to.”</i></p>
<p>Further, neither Sec. Kerry nor Carney stated what countries agree or disagree with the American narrative of Assad’s alleged chemical attack. Carney did say the president is seeking guidance from members of the US Congress on using force against Syria.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, passed in the US in 1973, use of military force is limited to instances when a formal declaration of war has been declared, specific statutory authorization is granted or during a national emergency. Without immediate congressional approval, the President can commit troops without a declaration of war.</p>
<p>In that case, the President must submit a report to Congress on the details of that action. Then after the 60-day period, Congress must approve further action, though the War Powers Resolution has been violated by US presidents in the past. The White House posited in 2011 that US military action without congressional approval in Libya did not violate the War Powers Resolution based on US forces’ supposed limited role in the NATO-led campaign.</p>
<p>While western forces appear ready for possible military action against Syria, Obama said in an interview Friday the United States should be wary of <i>“being drawn into very expensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region.”</i></p>
<p>Obama went on to express reservations for becoming involved in the 30-month Syrian conflict due to a lack of international consensus.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If the US goes in and attacks another country without a UN mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it, [and] do we have the coalition to make it work?”</i> said Obama.</p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel confirmed late last week that US military forces are preparing for the possibility that President Obama would order a strike.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Defense Department has a responsibility to provide the president with options for contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options — whatever options the president might choose,</i>&#8221; Hagel said Friday, adding a decision must be made quickly given <i>“there may be another (chemical) attack.”</i></p>

Secretary of State John Kerry (AFP Photo / Mark Wilson)</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that the Obama administration is &#8220;all but certain&#8221; that the Syrian government used chemical weapons to attack innocent civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note: </strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin told British Prime Minister David Cameron <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rt.com/news/putin-cameron-syria-attack-020/" target="_blank">earlier today</a> that they have no evidence that a chemical weapons attack took place or if it did, who was responsible for it.</p>
<p>Sec. Kerry made a statement from Washington, DC on Monday afternoon underscoring  that the White House has little doubt the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deployed chemical weapons on the outskirts of Damascus last week, killing hundreds.</p>
<p>Reports from Syria of chemical warfare “<i>should shock the conscience of the world</i>,” Kerry said, adding that the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children carried out by the Assad regime constitutes a “<i>moral obscenity</i>.”</p>
<p>President Barack Obama has yet to make a determination about how the US will respond, Kerry said, but a decision would be forthcoming. The US has already mobilized warships in the Mediterranean Sea which may begin striking Syrian target upon permission from Washington.</p>
<p>Kerry said the White House has “additional information” about this attack that is being compiled and reviewed by the administration and will be released in the days ahead.</p>
<p>“<i>While investigators are gathering additional information on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscious and guided by common sense</i>,” Sec. Kerry said. “<i>The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the first hand accounts from the humanitarian organizations on the ground . . . these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us are real: that chemical weapons were used in Syria</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Moreover, we know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these weapons</i>,” Kerry added.</p>
<p>Pres. Assad had been uncooperative with the United Nations’ requests to inspect military compounds for chemical weapons until this week, Kerry said, and a UN convoy sent to investigate this week reportedly found what the secretary called a “<i>cynical attempt</i>” to cover up a “<i>cowardly crime</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>That is not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide. That is not the action of a regime eager to prove to the world it had not used chemical weapons</i>,” said Kerry. Rather, the official said the Assad regime’s latest actions are “<i>too late to be credible</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Make no mistake</i>,” he added, “<i>President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people</i>.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday during a phone call with British Prime Minister David Cameron that there is no evidence such an attack had occurred.</p>
<p>“President Putin said that they did not have evidence of whether a chemical weapons attack had taken place or who was responsible,” a British government spokesperson said after the meeting.</p>
<p>Without specifically naming those who disagree with the White House’s narrative, Kerry said Monday that anyone willing to ignore or forget the human suffering witnessed in Syria last week must “<i>Check their conscious and their own moral compass</i>.”</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, White House press Secretary Jay Carney weighed in with a statement of his own saying that the use of chemical weapons on a widespread scale outside of Damascus on August 21 was &#8220;<i>undeniable</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“<i>What we are talking about here as Secretary Kerry made clear is a response to the clear violation of an international norm, and it is profoundly in the interest of the United States and the international community that that violation of an international norm be responded to</i>,” Mr. Carney said. <i>“The indiscriminate killing of innocent women and children and an attempt to maintain his bloody grasp on the power is despicable, but that is what we’ve come to expect from Bashar al-Assad.”</i></p>
<p>The president’s spokesperson added that the proof of a chemical warfare attack “<i>comes from sources well beyond the US government</i>,” and said Mr. Obama is discussing America’s options with the nation’s allies and members of Congress, opening up the possibility that lawmakers on Capitol Hill could approve a military strike to occur in the coming days.</p>
<p>“<i>The president makes decisions about military action or potential military action with the national security interests of the United States in mind. There is no weightier decision for the president and he has made that&#8230;clear</i>,” Mr. Carney said.</p>

<p>A non-profit organization says North Carolina police threatened to arrest members of the charity group for distributing food to more than 70 homeless people in downtown Raleigh on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Love Wins Ministries, a church group that tries to care for the city’s homeless, was preparing to serve breakfast on Saturday. The group had free coffee and sausage biscuits for more than 70 homeless people, but local police stopped the non-profit from handing it out. Police officers threatened to arrest anyone who tried to distribute food, claiming it violates one of the city’s ordinances but refusing to say which one.</p>
<p><i>“This morning we showed up at Moore Square at 9 a.m., just like we have done virtually every Saturday and Sunday for the last six years,”</i> Rev. Hugh Hollowell, the ministry’s pastor and director, wrote in a blog post. <i>“Today, officers from Raleigh Police Department prevented us from doing our work, for the first time ever. An officer said, quite bluntly, that if we attempted to distribute food, we would be arrested.”</i></p>
<p>Since 1998, Sec. 9-2022 of the rules governing city parks prohibits the distribution of food without a permit, but the non-profit claims its efforts were never previously halted. Hollowell was disturbed at the fact that police refused to name the ordinance that prohibits public food distribution, thereby keeping the group in the dark about what they were doing wrong.</p>
<p><i>“No representative from the Raleigh Police Department was willing to tell us which ordinance we were breaking, or why, after six years and countless friendly and cooperative encounters with the Department, they are now preventing us from feeding hungry people,”</i> Hollowell wrote on the group’s website. <i>“When I asked the officer why, he said that he was not going to debate me. ‘I am just telling you what is. Now you pass out that food, you will go to jail.’”</i></p>
<p>Hollowell told WRAL-TV that the police work for the mayor and the City Council, who oversee responsibility for the revitalization of downtown Raleigh. Even though his group cleans up the mess after serving meals, he believes the city perceives his efforts as a challenge to the revitalization effort.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Jim Sughrue told WRAL that no one was arrested on Saturday and members of the group were <i>“simply informed”</i> about the rules.</p>
<p>But Love Wins is not the only non-profit organization whose efforts to help the homeless were brought to an abrupt halt: another group, Human Beans Together, has already been notified that its members could no longer help the homeless on public grounds. In response, Human Beans moved its operations to a private parking lot, but police also asked them to leave that area on Sunday.</p>
<p><i> “We had lots of volunteers and lots of hungry people and nowhere to go,”</i> said volunteer Todd Pratt.</p>
<p>Mayor Nancy McFarlane and City Council member Mary-Ann Baldwin on Sunday pledged to address the matter this week and try to come up with a solution that will both keep the city clean and allow the non-profits to continue helping the homeless.</p>

<p>According to a report, commandos from the United States, Israel and Jordan are currently operating on the ground in Syria where they are fighting alongside and training the rebels.</p>
<p>Of course, the report, published by the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, has not been verified by officials in the U.S., Israel or Jordan, but if it is true it <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/08/19/syrian-opposition-admits-british-intelligence-is-assisting-terrorist-fsa-along-with-u-s-germany-and-turkey/" target="_blank">would not be all that surprising</a>.</p>
<p>After all, the U.S. is reportedly <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/23/us-readies-possible-missile-strike-against-syria-report/" target="_blank">readying for a possible missile strike on Syria</a> and <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/07/18/us-preparing-for-military-action-in-syria-top-us-general-says/" target="_blank">has been for some time</a>. The U.S. <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/06/14/us-to-leave-air-defense-weapons-in-jordan-along-syrian-border/" target="_blank">left air defense weapons in Jordan</a> along the Syrian border and has been <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/08/30/syrian-group-with-close-ties-to-fsa-terrorists-openly-arms-rebels-with-help-of-u-s/" target="_blank">helping</a> to <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/03/25/confirmed-us-shipping-weapons-to-syria-al-nusras-mystery-sponsors-revealed/" target="_blank">arm the rebels</a> for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">quite some time</a> along <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/02/10/us-allies-provide-syrian-rebels-with-weapons-at-the-wink-and-nod-of-washington-churkin-to-rt/" target="_blank">with allied nations</a>.</p>
<p>The joint operation, spearheaded by the CIA, began on Aug. 17, according to the <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/report-israeli-us-jordanian-commandos-operating-in-syria/2013/08/26/" target="_blank">Jewish Press</a>, citing <i>Le Figaro</i>.</p>
<p>On Aug. 17, the commandos joined around 300 Syrian rebels near Deraa, a city just north of the Syrian border with Jordan.</p>
<p>Two days later, a second group of commandos crossed the border into Syria and headed to Free Syrian Army training camps near the border with Jordan.</p>
<p><i>Le Figaro</i>, citing military sources, reported that the U.S. does not want to send ground troops into Syria and “is also hesitant about arming the rebels, as some groups are affiliated with radical Islamists, and would prefer to train opposition fighters to hold their own,” according to the Jewish Press.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. has indeed been responsible for putting arms in the hands of rebels (see above) and the U.S. seemed to have no problem with backing Islamists in Libya which <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/06/22/colonel-gaddafis-legacy-unregulated-libyan-weapons-flood-syria/" target="_blank">helped weapons pour into Syria</a>.</p>
<p>The paper quoted French experts who said that individuals in Washington were interested in creating a so-called buffer zone in Syria, free of Assad’s troops.</p>
<p>The buffer zone idea has been <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/01/18/the-syria-debacle-part-i/" target="_blank">toyed with for quite some time now</a> and individuals in the opposition have called for it multiple times <a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/11/18/russian-warships-entering-syrian-waters-to-inhibit-foreign-invasion-as-opposition-calls-for-no-fly-zone/" target="_blank">along with a no-fly zone</a>, which would reportedly also be enforced. Plans for a no-fly zone over Syria have <a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/11/23/as-predicted-arab-league-and-turkey-reportedly-plan-no-fly-zone-over-syria-with-u-s-logistical-support/" target="_blank">reportedly been in place since November 2011</a>.</p>
<p>With the United Nations team currently in Syria in an attempt to <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/21/un-investigation-needed-into-syria-chemical-attack-report/" target="_blank">investigate reports of chemical weapons attacks</a> outside Damascus, the situation is becoming increasingly volatile.</p>
<p>The U.S. has called for the United Nations team to abandon its mission and leave Syria, something which the UN has refused to do.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, the UN chemical weapons team was fired upon by unidentified snipers as they investigated the site of the alleged attack in Mouadhamiya, just a few miles southwest of Damascus, according to the <i><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323407104579036173795495190.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>.</i></p>
<p>The team initially retreated but returned later in the afternoon to continue the investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. made increasingly strong statements about the reported use of the weapons.</p>
<p>“Our confidence is growing that this was in fact an episode involving the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,” a senior U.S. official said, according to the <i>WSJ</i>.</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry is slated to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/kerry-syria-statement_n_3817596.html" target="_blank">deliver a statement</a> from the State Department at 2 p.m. Eastern time today.</p>

Participants run and dodge bulls in the Great Bull Run in Petersburg, Virginia August 24, 2013. (Reuters / Gary Cameron)</p>
<p>Virginia’s first “Great Bull Run” attracted thousands of spectators – but as they were watching out for horns and hooves, a strike came from the skies, as a drone capturing aerial images dropped on the crowds below, injuring at least four.</p>
<p>The unmanned aircraft dipped briefly and veered sharply left before plummeting into the stands at around 12 pm on Saturday. Some 8,000 people turned up for inaugural event held in Virginia Motorsports Park to watch the thousand-pound bulls sprint after hundreds of adrenaline-seeking participants.</p>
<p>People rushed to the scene of the accident with one person removing the machine from the midst of the crowd where it crashed.</p>
<p>Major W.B. Knott of the Dinwiddie County sheriff’s office told the Washington Post that four or five people suffered minor injuries and had to be treated by Emergency Medical Services personnel at the event, and none of them required hospitalization. One man was hit squarely in the face by the device.</p>
<p>Police have been trying to find out who owns the piece of equipment which measured approximately four feet in diameter and resembled a giant mechanized spider.</p>
<p>Pilotless drone technology has stirred concern for years, being renowned for its stealthy air assaults.</p>
<p>The smaller, personal fliers can be procured for some $300. Towards the end of June, one man was arrested for sending a flying camera drone to snap aerial images of Pretoria hospital, near Johannesburg, in which former South African president Nelson Mandela was dying.</p>
<p><img alt="Participants run and dodge bulls in the Great Bull Run in Petersburg, Virginia August 24, 2013. (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" src="http://rt.com/files/news/20/3a/20/00/rtx12vb5.jpg" /><br />

<p>Surveillance drones are already in use by law enforcement officials and can carry on-board live-feed video cameras, infrared cameras and radar. Some cameras are capable of reading milk cartons from as high as 60,000 feet, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>By 2015, commercial entities will be allowed to apply for authorization to use drones.</p>
<p>The Great Bull Run over which the drone was flying to capture footage is modeled after the famous San Fermin festival in Pamplona, Spain, and has created controversy both for the potential dangers it poses to participants and for possible animal cruelty.</p>
<p>The website for the Virginia event states that appropriate safety measures are taken for the US adaptation, proudly proclaiming that: <i>“In fact, there have been only 15 deaths in the Pamplona running of the bulls in the past 102 years!”</i></p>
<p>The event as a whole featured live bands, drinking, games and a tomato fight alongside the bull races, of which there were seven. Some 24 beasts took part in the final sprint and 700 runners also participated.</p>
<p>An animal rights organization petitioned the city of Conyers in Georgia on the same day of the event in Virginia about a future festival planned for October. <i>“No matter how cautious the organizers may appear to be, there is no way to ensure that the animals won’t suffer or be injured at these events,”</i> the petition stated. <i><br />
</i></p>
<p><i>“After having been loaded on to trucks and herded into an arena filled with thousands of screaming people, the bulls will bolt out of the pen in a state of panic, confusion and terror when the starting gate opens. As they rush through the chute, they can crash into the barriers, fall and break their legs or collide with and injure each other.”</i> The petition achieved nearly 1,400 signatures within 72 hours.</p>

<p>On this day two years ago, Libyan rebels were transferring their government to Tripoli. However, the anniversary is marred by an acute parliamentary crisis, a severe economic slump and the country becoming the main base for Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb.</p>
<p>August could have been a month of festivities in Libya, marking the watershed in the rebels’ fight against Muammar Gaddafi, who had to flee Tripoli. Even though it would still be two months before the fugitive dictator was captured and brutally killed, the insurgents celebrated their victory and had their government transferred from the cradle of the revolution, Benghazi, to the capital.</p>
<p>The euphoria of the revolution has all but gone now, as Libya finds itself mired in deep political crisis as well as economic turmoil.</p>
<p>“<i>We do not feel the taste of happiness, security and stability</i>,” a resident of Tripoli is cited as saying by Libya Herald, “<i>nor did we have any benefit from the government. People are now feeling insecure and live in fear because of killings that are being witnessed all over Libya</i>.”</p>
<p>The government’s ruling Justice and Construction party, controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood movement, has been facing tough confrontation with the opposition.  Fearing the Egypt-style scenario, the president of congress, Nuri Abu Sahmain, had militias allied to the Brotherhood summoned to the capital.</p>
<p>The main opposition party, the National Forces Alliance, which mostly consisted in anti-Gaddafi rebels, has announced the suspension of its political activity in protest against the move.</p>
<p>“<i>I am not sure that it will be right to assume that there is a government in Libya. There is no army, no police, armed militias are in control. There is violent chaos</i>,” Yehudit Ronen, professor of political science at Bar Ilan University, told RT.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) says a wave of assassinations has killed dozens of politicians, activists, judges and members of security agencies.</p>
<p>“<i>At least 51 people have died in a broadening wave of apparent political assassinations in the cities of Benghazi and Derna in volatile eastern Libya. Authorities have not prosecuted anyone for these crimes</i>,” an HRW report of August 8 states.</p>
<p>Militias, representing diverse interests have impacted decision-making in Libya. Earlier this year armed groups held the Libyan Foreign Ministry and the Justice Ministry <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rt.com/news/libya-gaddafi-fall-anniversary-981/%20http://rt.com/news/libya-bans-gaddafi-officials-855/" target="_blank">besieged</a>, pushing through the Political Isolation law, according to which Gaddafi-era officials were denied the right to be part of the new government.</p>
<p>“<i>All we hear is very troublesome, because we hear about clandestine detention centers, detention centers that are run by militias that are not accountable to anybody,</i>” Juan Mendez, UN rapporteur on torture told RT.</p>

<p>Unable to cope with militias the government has reportedly turned to Gaddafi-era surveillance techniques, according to anonymous officials the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304782404577488493816611850.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>With all of these troubling reports coming out of Libya, there’s quite an optimistic vision of the situation though within the General National Congress (GNC).</p>
<p>“<i>Now we have improved dramatically. We have security committee for Benghazi. We have a special committee in the GNC that’s dealing with the Human Rights Watch</i>,” said Suleiman Awad Faraj Zubi, a member of parliament, in an interview with RT.</p>
<p>However he admitted that the government did “<i>have a lack of power on the ground in certain areas</i>.”</p>
<p>Those must be the areas voicing their desire to break away from Libya as Cyrenaica and Fezzan, which are seeking autonomy. Both of the regions possess oil reserves, which could be blocked if the breakaway spirit prevails.</p>
<p>Two years after Gaddafi regime fall the country’s constitution is yet to be adopted. There are fears that once finally in place, the constitution will fail to address the needs of all of the diverse communities within the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Libyan society consists of Arabs, Berbers and Tebu, so the constitution should represent all segments of Libyan society and if any group of Libyan society is ignored, then this means exclusion</i>,&#8221;  Najmi Maylowd, Berber protestor told RT.</p>
<p>Earlier in August the Berbers stormed the Libyan parliament to protest against what they believe is their marginalization. The Berbers – who make up 10 percent of the population – fear their language and culture are not going to be protected by the future constitution. On July 25, Berbers shut down a gas pipeline, going through their territory in the western district of Nalout.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, work at Libya&#8217;s oilfields and ports have been regularly paralyzed because of sporadic strikes by security guards.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Libya has lost $1.6 billion in oil sales since July 25 until today,</i>&#8221; Oil Minister Abdelbari al-Arusi was cited by Reuters on August 16.</p>
<p>Libya&#8217;s Prime Minister Ali Zeidan even promised to use military force to prevent striking at the country&#8217;s main ports. Libya’s two main crude oil terminals have however remained shut, which means the country’s economic recovery after the 2011 unrest has been derailed.</p>

<p>And as if economic turmoil and infighting weren&#8217;t enough, reports emerged of Al-Qaeda making Southern Libya its new base of operations, following its members being ousted from the nearby Mali, following the French intervention to fight the Islamist insurgency there.</p>
<p>At least that was what an anonymous top Libyan intelligence official said in an interview to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/06/the-al-qaeda-headquarters-in-libya.html" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a>.</p>
<p>“<i>Libya has become AQIM’s [Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb] headquarters</i>,” the intelligence source was cited as saying.</p>
<p>Abayomi Azikiwe, editor of the Pan-Africa Newswire, predicts that the instability in the post-Gaddafi Libya will only get worse.</p>
<p>“<i>This kind of revolution has been detrimental to the wellbeing of the Libyan people. What we’ve seen over the last few years is a total disruption of Libyan society. There’s no plan for the national restoration of Libya. Many of the key political players involved in an attempt to run Libya right now are divided over tribal, regional as well as political levels</i>,” Azikiwe told RT.</p>
<p>“<i>And until the general national council government there reigns in the malicious and tries to bring about some type of national reconciliation process, the economic decline and consequently the social instability will intensify.</i>”</p>

<p>The US sees “very little doubt” Syria used chemical weapons against civilians &#8211; something President Obama had described as a “red line.” However, Moscow has reminded Washington of similar mistakes over Iraq, and warned it not to breach international law.</p>
<p>A senior Obama administration official said on Sunday that the US intelligence community based its assessment on &#8220;<i>the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, and witness accounts,</i>&#8221; AP reports.</p>
<p>This comes as the US military has <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rt.com/news/syria-obama-serious-response-952/" target="_blank">presented</a> President Barack Obama with potential options for action in Syria and US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has indicated the Pentagon is ready to exercise these options, should Obama give the order.</p>
<p>Russia warned that the alleged chemical attack could have been a staged <i>“provocation</i>” by the Syrian opposition forces and said US rhetoric recalled the allegations preceding the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>“<i>All of this makes one recall the events that happened 10 years ago, when, using false information about Iraqis having weapons of mass destruction, the US bypassed the United Nations and started a scheme whose consequences are well known to everyone</i>,” the Russian Foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>“<i>Once again we call not to repeat past mistakes, not to allow actions that contradict international law,”</i> the ministry said.</p>
<p>On Sunday Syria <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rt.com/news/syria-green-light-chemical-inspection-967/" target="_blank">gave the “green light</a>” for UN experts to visit the site of an alleged chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb. The UN said its chemical weapons experts will start probing the site in the suburb of Ghouta as early as Monday.</p>
<p>Moscow has welcomed the move but has called on all the sides, “<i>trying to influence the results of the investigation in advance,”</i> not to “<i>make tragic mistakes.</i>”</p>
<p>However Washington has not been satisfied with the agreement, saying that Syria’s offer to allow UN inspectors access to the attack site was <i>“too late to be credible.</i>”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Pentagon is moving naval forces closer to Syria in preparation for an order to attack from Obama. Reports say that among the military options under consideration are missile strikes on Syrian units believed to be responsible for the chemical attack, or on Assad&#8217;s air force and ballistic missile sites.</p>
<p>Reports suggest the British navy is also preparing to take part in a possible series of cruise missile strikes. According to The Telegraph citing sources within the UK government, military action that was agreed could begin within the next week.</p>
