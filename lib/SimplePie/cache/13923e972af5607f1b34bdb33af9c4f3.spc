A very common excuse that some people give as to why they cannot prep is their current location. People say, “Well, once we are able to get moved to our farm in two years I’ll start prepping hardcore.” Another favorite is “I’m saving the money for moving instead of using it for preps.” Or even worse, ”Oh, there is no point in prepping here, because if the SHTF I’ll be dead.”</p>
<p><strong>Stop this kind of thinking RIGHT NOW!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, to borrow an old saying, you just have to bloom where you’re planted.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to increase your preparedness wherever you happen to live. Apartment dwellers at the top of a city high rise, folks in the middle of the desert, and people in HOA-ruled suburban lots all have to examine their situations, figure out their pros and cons, and work towards resolving what they can. With some pre-planning, there is a lot you can overcome if you have the right mindset. I suspect there are just as many (and probably far more) preppers living in the ‘burbs than there are living in perfect rural locations, with a lake, 10 acres of cultivated farmland in an off-grid house.</p>
<p>Money is tight all over. It’s very easy for people to say, off-the-cuff, “Oh, you should move.”</p>
<p>But just picking up and moving isn’t that easy. It took me nearly 4 years to be able to do that. People have obligations and ties that some Joe-Blow on the internet shouting out advice can’t even begin to understand. Some in the prepping community have a complete disconnect with the realities of everyday people. There are reasons like:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Not enough money to leave</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A good job (very hard to come by these days)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Family members in the area that you don’t want to abandon</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">No work opportunities where you want to go</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Custody orders that require you to remain in a certain area</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A spouse who is not on board</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A house that won’t sell or with an upside-down mortgage</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The list goes on and on. There are as many reasons to remain in one place as there are people living in cities. And yes, I could sit here and refute each and every reason a person has chosen to remain, but it wouldn’t do one bit of good. People are sometimes alienated by the prepping movement when it seems that everything is black and white or like their personal decisions are somehow less valid than the decisions of some random person on the internet.</span></p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to take your current situation, warts and all, and work with it. This doesn’t mean that you should abandon your plans for a better location some time in the future if such a move is warranted. But it means that you shouldn’t put off important preparedness steps until after that move is made.</p>
<p><strong>Assess Your Situation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><a class="highslide" onclick="return vz.expand(this)" href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/sustainable-in-the-city-bloom-where-you-are-planted_23072013/high-rise-building-300x190/" rel="attachment wp-att-17728"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17728" title="High-Rise-Building-300x190" src="http://readynutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/High-Rise-Building-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" /></a>You don’t know where to go if you don’t know where you are. The first and most vital step is an honest assessment of your current situation. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The situation that you have right now, this very minute, not the one you will have in a month or in a year.</span></p>
<p>Prepping is all about pre-planning and knowing what you need in order to thrive.</p>
<p>Assess your needs regarding the following in a SHTF scenario or disaster:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Water</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Sanitation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Food/Cooking</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Heating</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Security</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Light</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you know exactly where you are with these things, you can begin to look for solutions that will work for you, today. Dig in and make a plan for the survival of your family.</span></p>
<p>And a little note to those who say, “It doesn’t matter, I’m in downtown Manhattan. I’ll die anyway.”</p>
<p>No, you won’t. You won’t be that lucky. You will be absolutely thoroughly miserable, breathing foul unhealthy air. You’ll be thirsty enough to drink unsanitary water, which will cause bowel issues to worsen problem #1. You’ll be hungry, but not hungry enough that you die of starvation. You will be at the mercy of thugs better armed than you. And you won’t die, not right away. You will live like I just described, and it will be horrible. Look at the residents of Manhattan during Hurricane Sandy. They didn’t die but they were absolutely miserable, they were terrified, they were eating from dumpsters, and much of it could have been avoided with some basic preparedness.</p>
<h3><strong>Survival in a Population Dense Area</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>Before I relocated to my little cabin in the woods I lived in a very metropolitan area. I was lucky in that I had 1/10th of an acre. I did everything I could come up with to make my little house as sustainable as possible should the poop hit the oscillating device before I could get out. A disaster in the city IS survivable.</p>
<p>I planted every inch of the back yard and grew enough food that the home-canned and frozen produce lasted until Christmas. I stockpiled groceries. I had plywood cut and pre-drilled to cover each window of the house. I had printed official looking quarantine signs to hang on the door of my house as a deterrent. I put together a little outdoor fireplace in the backyard behind my fence. I got a big dog. I collected rainwater from downspouts at each corner of the house. I purchased an antique oil heater in good working order, and stockpiled heating oil. I had enough seeds to plant for the next 4 years. I located nearby sources of water, wood, and nuts. I got a wagon for hauling stuff if the transportation system was down.</p>
<p>In short, I did everything possible to make the best of a potentially terrible location. It wasn’t perfect, but we would have outlasted most of the other people in our residential neighborhood and done so under the radar.</p>
<h3><strong>The Priorities</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong> Let’s take a look at each of the major challenges that we face in a SHTF situation. Obviously different disasters offer different challenges. These lists aren’t meant to be comprehensive. They are meant to be a starting point to get your wheels turning on how you and your family can best survive, exactly where you’re planted right now.</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<p>You can only survive for 3 days without water (and you’ll be weak and suffering way before that) so that should put water preparedness at the very top of your list. Some ideas: 1 month supply of drinking water stored (plan on a gallon per day, per person and pet), non-electric water filtration system (with spare filters), buckets along with a sled or wheel barrow depending on the season for transporting water, a water catchment system, water purification supplies (bleach, pool shock, tablets), system for catching gray water to be reused for flushing, washing, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Sanitation</strong></p>
<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York, it was reported that people were defecating and urinating in the hallways of apartment buildings once the sewer system stopped working. Lack of sanitation is not only unpleasant, but it spreads disease. Some ideas: portapotty, buckets lined with heavy duty trash bags, kitty litter, water for flushing if you have septic, learn how to shut off the main valve so that city sewage cannot back up into your house or apartment, supplies to build an outhouse, lime, baby wipes,antibacterial wipes, white vinegar, bleach, hand sanitizer, extra toilet paper.</p>
<p><strong>Food/Cooking</strong></p>
<p>Most preppers have a food supply, but have you considered how you’re going to prepare all those beans if your stove doesn’t work? Some ideas: Minimum of 1 month of food for each family member and pet; alternative cooking methods indoors like a fondue pot, a woodstove, propane stove, or fireplace; outdoor cooking methods like a barbecue (beware of tantalizing smells and hungry neighbors), outdoor fireplace or firepit, rocket stove, or sun oven; and foods that don’t require cooking or heating.</p>
<p><strong>Heating</strong></p>
<p>This depends upon your climate and the time of year that disaster strikes. Prioritize accordingly. Some ideas: wood stove, fireplace, oil heater, kerosene heater, propane heater, coal heater; non-tech ideas like arctic sleeping bags, winter clothes and accessories, covers for windows, segregating one room to heat.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>In a disaster situation, the risk of potentially violent civil unrest always goes up. We used a two-fold approach of trying to avoid conflict by keeping a low profile, but being ready to deal with it if it couldn’t be avoided. Some ideas: personal defense items (this will vary depending on your location, the laws there, and whether or not you intend to follow those laws), secure heavy doors with reinforced frames, plywood or gridwork to cover the windows, keeping lights off or low, thorny plants around the perimeter of your house and yard, hardening access points, a big dog, an alarm system, and visual deterrents such as warning signs and quarantine signs.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the value of light in a dark world. Most city dwellers don’t consider exactly how dark the night can be without streetlights and lights from houses. Emotionally, having a bit of light can help soothe frazzled children (or adults) and help the night seem a little less scary. Use caution that your light cannot be seen from the outside – like moths to a flame, people will be drawn to the only brightly lit house on the street. Some ideas: Solar garden lights, candles, kerosene lights, oil lights, flashlights, headlamps, battery operated LED lights, solar camping lanterns.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Plan</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><a class="highslide" onclick="return vz.expand(this)" href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/sustainable-in-the-city-bloom-where-you-are-planted_23072013/remington_vegetable_garden/" rel="attachment wp-att-17729"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-17729" title="remington_vegetable_garden" src="http://readynutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/remington_vegetable_garden.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="403" /></a> So, if you’re reading this and you’ve been putting off preparedness due to your location, what’s your plan?</p>
<p>If you’ve been feeling disheartened by all the folks grimly telling you that your home is a death trap, what can you do over the weekend to improve your chances, right where you are?</p>
<p>And if you are fortunate enough to be in an ideal location, please share your ideas about overcoming some of these difficulties in a less than perfect place on the map. As a community, we can all help one another solve problems that could otherwise seem insurmountable.

<p>As a prepper, you want your child to also be prepared for any crisis that might occur when they are out on their own.  My lovely eldest daughter has just graduated from high school, and we put together a dorm-room preparedness kit for her college apartment. Following, you can see the list of supplies that we have assembled.  Different climates will, of course, require different types of preparedness items.</p>
<h2>Food and Water</h2>
<p>If there is a long term power outage, you want to be sure that your student stays fed and hydrated until you can get them home.  Depending on the situation, they may have to shelter in place for a time.  Base the length of your supply on the distance from home.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cases of water bottles</li>
<li>2-3 five gallon jugs of water</li>
<li>1 portable water filter (My daughter has a Go Berkey)</li>
<li>A 2-4 week supply of long-term storage food that doesn’t require power for preparation (Get some ideas<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/power-outage-picnic-02062013" target="_blank"> here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal Defense Items</h2>
<p>Be sure to check the rules of the dormitory and weigh the pros and cons of your solutions for this matter.  This will depend upon your student and his or her level of competence and responsibility, and only you can make the correct assessment of the situation.  The following recommendations will not be appropriate in all situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Pepper spray/dog spray/bear spray</li>
<li>Knives</li>
<li>A self defense course (these are often offered on-campus</li>
</ul>
<h2>First Aid Supplies</h2>
<p>Your child should have a well-stocked first aid kit, including supplies for an illness like the flu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandages</li>
<li>Antibiotic ointment</li>
<li>Alcohol pads</li>
<li>Steri-strips</li>
<li>Betadine</li>
<li>Diarrhea remedies</li>
<li>Tums or Pepto Bismol</li>
<li>Anti-nausea medication or ginger tablets</li>
<li>Cold medicine (daytime and nighttime)</li>
<li>Pain relief (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and/or acetaminophen)</li>
<li>Hot water bottle</li>
<li>Reusable cold packs</li>
<li>Tensor bandages</li>
<li>Herbal teas like ginger, peppermint, and chamomile</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sanitation</h2>
<p>During a power outage, particularly in a multi-story building, sanitation could become an issue. (Remember the high-rises in NYC during Hurricane Sandy?)  The following supplies can help to keep your student healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme heavy duty garbage bags, a bucket, and some kitty litter for a makeshift toilet</li>
<li>Antibacterial hand sanitizer</li>
<li>Antibacterial wipes</li>
<li>Additional stored water for cleaning</li>
<li>Lysol or other antiseptic spray</li>
<li>Extra towels to stuff under the door to keep out unpleasant smells</li>
<li>Baby wipes for personal hygiene</li>
<li>Paper plates, cups, and cutlery</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Miscellaneous Items</span></h2>
<p>Be sure that your student has the following supplies on hand to deal with an emergency such as a<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/getting-started-prepping-for-a-two-week-power-outage-06292013" target="_blank"> power outage</a> or other crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Candles</li>
<li>Matches/Lighter</li>
<li>Bug-out bag</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Maps with multiple routes home, including walking and driving routes</li>
<li>Cold-rated sleeping bag</li>
</ul>
<h2>OPSEC</h2>
<p>It is vital to stress the importance of OPSEC (Operational Security), especially in a shared living environment.  Your young adult should be very careful about letting others know that he or she possesses self defense items or preparedness supplies.  In a small space it can be difficult to keep things hidden, but a great deal of food and water can be shoved under a bed.  Self defense items can be stashed in a backpack.  Other supplies can be stored in the closet in luggage.</p>
<h2>Prepper Mentality</h2>
<p>Of course, we all know that the most important prep is your mind. If your son or daughter understands the preparedness mindset, they will be head and shoulders above the rest in a crisis situation. Because my daughter has been raised in a household that values preparedness, she is well-aware of the things that can happen.  She understands the mob mentality that can arise during a disaster and she is well-versed in <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/survival-of-the-most-adapatable-01202013" target="_blank">being adaptable</a>, of thinking things through and making a plan.  As well, she has learned many things that aren’t common for your average teenage girl today, like starting fires, cooking from scratch, and outdoor skills.</p>
<p>Some great courses for a teenager are:</p>
<ul>
<li>First aid</li>
<li>CPR</li>
<li>Wilderness survival</li>
<li>Orienteering</li>
<li>Self defense</li>
<li>Water safety</li>
</ul>
<p>As a family, you should have a plan for different types of emergencies.  Will your young adult try to make their way home to you in the event of a crisis or should they shelter in place and wait for you to get to them?  Are there special concerns in their particular area that should be planned for, like a nuclear power facility, an earthquake or tornado prone locale, or extreme climate conditions?  By having a plan in place before disaster strikes, everyone will be on the same page and the response to the crisis will be automatic, saving valuable time and energy, as well as providing some peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Time to Fly</h2>
<p>As parents, it is our job to prepare our children for life outside of the nest.  We have to let go so they can fly.  By providing them with a solid base of knowledge, supplies, and advice so that we can rest assured they will thrive as they begin their lives as independent adults.</p>
<p>Has your junior prepper left the nest?  What other suggestions do you have for dorm-room preppers?</p>

<p>I have suggested to readers that allotting a certain percentage of your monthly budget and using it for emergency preparation is an advantageous investment for your future well being.  Many have remarked that with the economy on the down slope, they simply cannot afford to use a portion of their budgets towards preparations.  My response back to them is, &#8220;Can you afford not to be prepared?</p>
<h3>FEMA  Wants Every Home To Have 2 Weeks Worth of Food</h3>
<p>As a whole, most of the population is not prepared for an unforeseen disaster. Many emergency websites such as <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&amp;web.pdf" target="_blank">FEMA</a> has stressed how important it is to be prepared.  Specifically, FEMA  has suggested that each family should have <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at a minimum</span></em> of a three day supply of food, but should not limit it to that amount. In fact, they go on to suggest each household have a two week supply as well.  Statistics state that the average family household has <em>3 days</em> or less of food in their homes. With that knowledge in hand, it is safe to say that most of the population is ill equipped to handle an unforeseen extended emergency, and the result is a formula for epic disaster.</p>
<p>Simply put, when human beings basic needs are not met, their once passive natures dissolves and a more aggressive side replaces it. When an entire population&#8217;s needs are not being met, what do you think will happen? 4 words &#8211; complete and utter pandemonium. The unspoken truth is there is simply not enough food in the stores to supply a large population all at once. As a result, many families will go without food and chaos will ensue.</p>
<p>Point and fact, many who live in areas where extreme weather occurs understand and plan for the masses to rush the stores at the last possible moment to stock up on supplies. Some  are able to buy a surplus of goods (if they get to the stores in time), and some people get there too late and walk home empty handed. The supply of food has run out because everyone is buying the same types of foods. Foods such as basic food pantry, canned goods, bread, condiments, water, batteries, flashlights, emergency supplies, etc. Having these supplies at home will eliminate the stress of fighting the hoards in the stores.</p>
<h3>Preparing Provides Peace of Mind</h3>
<p>Accumulating an emergency food supply can be achieved even on the most modest of budgets. Rather than getting food all at once, stock up a little at a time to maintain your monthly budget.</p>
<p>Another method of creating a preparedness supply is to break your emergency food list up into different categories such as breakfast foods, grains, water, baking needs, etc. Typically you will need the following types of foods:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Breakfast</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Snacks</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Lunch</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Dinner</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Beverages</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Another method is bargain shopping. Go to the Dollar stores in your area and see what canned goods or boxed dinners are available. Other preparedness items such as batteries, flashlights and duct tape may also be available. Each time a person goes to the store, they can buy a portion of their food supply and store it away for later use. In a matter of a few weeks to 1 month&#8217;s time, a modest amount of food has been stored.  To find how much food a family needs, many preppers use this <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/category/preparedness/calculators/" target="_blank">food storage calculator</a>.  Although, many of our budgets are dwindling due to the bad economy, there are ways of <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/7-ways-to-save-a-buck_02112010/" target="_blank">stretching your budget</a> and changing your lifestyle in order to prepare.</p>
<p>Being prepared can put a person way ahead of the game. While many who are unprepared for disasters will be battling the lines at the grocery stores, those that have prepared can concentrate on other matters at hand: their families well being.

<p>An air conditioner is one of the most expensive appliances you can run.  Staying comfortable with less demand on your electrical supply will also help your budget.</p>
<p>How can you keep your cool in temperatures like this?  Take your cues from third world countries near the equator, where few people have electricity, let alone air conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>Take a siesta.</strong>  In Mexico, everything closes down during the hottest part of the day.  People take a few hours to relax or nap mid-afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Dunk your head.</strong>  If you wet your hair, the evaporation of the water will help to cool down your body.  If you don’t have hair, sit a wet cloth on top of your head for a similar effect.</p>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong>  Drink plenty of water.  Do not rely on caffeinated beverages, as they actually dehydrate the body.</p>
<p><strong>Wet t-shirt contest.</strong>  No, not that kind.  Wetting a shirt and then putting it on will have the same evaporative cooling effect as keeping your hair wet.</p>
<p><strong>Go for a swim.</strong>  Or at the very least, a soak in the tub.  Immersing your body in tepid to cool water is a great way to cool down.</p>
<p><strong>Wear natural fibers.</strong>  Dress in cotton or linen instead of polyester or other synthetic fibers.  Synthetic fibers trap heat next to your body, while natural fibers “breathe” and allow the heat to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Wear light colors.</strong>  Dark colors absorb heat and light colors reflect it.</p>
<p><strong>Eat spicy food.</strong>  Have you ever noticed that the regions with the spiciest cuisines tend to also have the hottest weather?  Spicy food increases perspiration, which works as your body’s evaporative cooling system.</p>
<p><strong>Go downstairs.</strong>  Heat rises, so spend time in the lowest level of your home.  If you have a basement, that will be the coolest place in your house.  Not only is it the lowest level, but the earth insulating the basement will keep it cooler and more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Close your curtains</strong>.  During the hottest part of the day, keep your curtains and blinds tightly shut to reduce the solar effects of the sunlight in your house.  Blackout curtains have the best insulating value and will keep your house cooler.</p>
<p><strong>Make a refrigerator.</strong>  Did you know that you can make a clay pot “refrigerator” to keep foods cool?  Learn how <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/shtf-survival-clay-pot-refrigeration_22092011/">HERE</a>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Speaking of refrigeration, another concern when the power goes out during hot weather is the status of your perishable food.  Tess Pennington wrote during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, “So how long will your food last when the electricity goes out? Refrigerated food will stay cold for 4-6 hours assuming the door is left closed as much as possible.  After that time, many of the items in your refrigerator should be discarded.  This <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/keeping_food_Safe_during_an_emergency/index.asp">chart</a> from the USDA offers guidelines. In a fully stocked freezer, frozen foods will remain safely frozen for approximately two day.”    It’s important to follow these <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/how-to-protect-your-food-supply-during-power-disruptions_02112012/">guidelines for food safety during and after a power outage</a>.

<p>Many of us are guilty in this day and age of leaving lights on all over the house.  We tend to use a great deal of power keeping things bright.  There are many sources of <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/week-27-of-52-emergency-light-sources_02122011/">off grid lighting</a>.  Some of them offer simple methods to reduce your current electric bills and can be used right away, while you might wish to reserve others for times that you don’t have the option of electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Go solar.</strong>  Even without an expensive solar set up, you can still use the power of the sun to light up your life.  Invest in some of the following for light on demand.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Garden stakes</em>:  You can buy these at the dollar store to build up your supply.  Leave them outside to charge during the day and bring them in and stick them in vases at night.  Note that there is nearly always an on/off switch inside the light to conserve collected power.</li>
<li><em>Fairy lights</em>:  Hang these outdoors on your patio or front entry for a bit of extra security.  You can also place them in a sunny window inside your house for a power-free night light.</li>
<li><em>Camping Lanterns</em>:  Solar camping lanterns won’t run for as long on a charge as garden stakes but will provide a much brighter light, suitable for reading or detail work like sewing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battery power.</strong>  Flashlights and headlamps are important items in your lighting arsenal. These allow you to take your light with you and easily switch it on and off.  Headlamps offer hands-free lighting. Look into batteries that can be recharged with solar devices for more sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Crank Power.</strong>  You can get flashlights and lanterns that are powered with a hand crank.  These proved approximately 15 minutes of light for each minute spent winding the crank.  You’d be surprised at how long a minute is when you’re cranking something – these are for short term usage, but definitely valuable to have.</p>
<p><strong>Oil Lamps.</strong>  Oil lamps are a wonderful, old-fashioned way of lighting a room.  They have the added bonus of providing a small amount of heat.  Highly flammable, great care must be taken with oil lamps, particularly with pets and small children around.  They provide sufficiently lighting for detailed work and reading.  The smell is slightly unpleasant, but in a pinch, used cooking oil can be used in oil lamps.  Be sure to store extra oil and wicks if planning to use oil lamps as a light source.</p>
<p><strong>Candles.</strong>  Simple, old-fashioned, inexpensive and portable, candles are emergency lighting 101.  Look for candles at yard sales and thrift stores.  Dollar stores are also a good source of votive candles and tapers.  Store your candles in a cool place – high temperatures can cause them to melt and warp.  You can learn to make candles from simple household items <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/5-ways-to-make-candles-from-household-items_30052012/">HERE</a>.

<p>Heat related deaths are the number 1 weather related killer in the United States. Although this type of death is preventable, annually many people succumb to extreme heat. Historically, from 1979-2003, excessive heat exposure caused 8,015 deaths in the United States. During this period, more people in this country died from extreme heat than from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined. In 2001, 300 deaths were caused by excessive heat exposure.</p>
<p>People suffer heat-related illness when their bodies are unable to compensate and properly cool themselves. The body normally cools itself through sweating but under extreme heat, sweating just isn&#8217;t enough. In such cases, a person&#8217;s body temperature rises rapidly and very high body temperatures can damage the brain or other vital organs.</p>
<p>Several factors affect the body&#8217;s ability to cool itself during extremely hot weather. When the humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, preventing the body from releasing heat quickly. Other conditions related to the risk include age, obesity, fever, dehydration, heart disease, mental illness, poor circulation, sunburn, and prescription drug and alcohol use.</p>
<p>Because heat-related deaths are preventable, people need to be aware of who is at greatest risk and what actions can be taken to prevent a heat-related illness or death. The elderly, the very young, and those with mental illness and chronic diseases are all at highest risk. However, even young and healthy individuals can succumb to heat if they participate in strenuous physical activities during hot weather. Your risk to heat related illnesses can be reduced by staying hydrated and being in an air conditioned environment. If a home is not air-conditioned, spend time in public facilities that are air-conditioned.</p>
<h3>What Is Extreme Heat?</h3>
<p>Conditions of extreme heat are defined as summertime temperatures that are substantially hotter and/or more humid than average for location at that time of year. Humid or muggy conditions, which add to the discomfort of high temperatures, occur when a &#8220;dome&#8221; of high atmospheric pressure traps hazy, damp air near the ground. Extremely dry and hot conditions can provoke dust storms and low visibility. Droughts occur when a long period passes without substantial rainfall. A heat wave combined with a drought is a very dangerous situation.</p>
<h3>During Hot Weather</h3>
<p>To protect your health when temperatures are extremely high, remember to keep cool and use common sense. The following tips are important:</p>
<p><strong>Drink Plenty of Fluids. </strong>During hot weather you will need to increase your fluid intake, regardless of your activity level. Don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re thirsty to drink. During heavy exercise in a hot environment, drink two to four glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour. Don&#8217;t drink liquids that contain alcohol, or large amounts of sugar—these actually cause you to lose more body fluid. Also avoid very cold drinks, because they can cause stomach cramps.</p>
<p>Warning: If your doctor generally limits the amount of fluid you drink or has you on water pills, ask how much you should drink while the weather is hot.</p>
<p><strong>Replace Salt and Minerals. </strong>Heavy sweating removes salt and minerals from the body. These are necessary for your body and must be replaced. If you must exercise, drink two to four glasses of cool, non-alcoholic fluids each hour.  <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/diy-electrolyte-powders_21062011/" target="_blank">Drinks</a> that have electrolytes can replace the salt and minerals you lose in sweat. However, if you are on a low-salt diet, talk with your doctor before drinking a sports beverage or taking salt tablets.</p>
<p><strong>Wear Appropriate Clothing and Sunscreen. </strong>Wear as little clothing as possible when you are at home. Choose lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. Sunburn affects your body&#8217;s ability to cool itself and causes a loss of body fluids. It also causes pain and damages the skin. If you must go outdoors, protect yourself from the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat (also keeps you cooler) along with sunglasses, and by putting on sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher (the most effective products say &#8220;broad spectrum&#8221; or &#8220;UVA/UVB protection&#8221; on their labels) 30 minutes prior to going out. Continue to reapply it according to the package directions.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule Outdoor Activities Carefully. </strong>If you must be outdoors, try to limit your outdoor activity to morning and evening hours. Try to rest often in shady areas so that your body&#8217;s thermostat will have a chance to recover.</p>
<p><strong>Pace Yourself. </strong>If you are not accustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment, start slowly and pick up the pace gradually. If exertion in the heat makes your heart pound and leaves you gasping for breath, STOP all activity. Get into a cool area or at least into the shade, and rest, especially if you become lightheaded, confused, weak, or faint.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Cool Indoors. </strong>Stay indoors and, if at all possible, stay in an air-conditioned place. If your home does not have air conditioning, go to the shopping mall or public library—even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler when you go back into the heat. Call your local health department to see if there are any heat-relief shelters in your area. Electric fans may provide comfort, but when the temperature is in the high 90s, fans will not prevent heat-related illness. Taking a cool shower or bath or moving to an air-conditioned place is a much better way to cool off. Use your stove and oven less to maintain a cooler temperature in your home.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Buddy System. </strong>When working in the heat, monitor the condition of your co-workers and have someone do the same for you. Heat-induced illness can cause a person to become confused or lose consciousness. If you are 65 years of age or older, have a friend or relative call to check on you twice a day during a heat wave. If you know someone in this age group, check on them at least twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor Those at High Risk. </strong>Although anyone at any time can suffer from heat-related illness, some people are at greater risk than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infants and young children are sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and rely on others to regulate their environments and provide adequate liquids.</li>
<li>People 65 years of age or older may not compensate for heat stress efficiently and are less likely to sense and respond to change in temperature.</li>
<li>People who are overweight may be prone to heat sickness because of their tendency to retain more body heat.</li>
<li>People who overexert during work or exercise may become dehydrated and susceptible to heat sickness.</li>
<li>People who are physically ill, especially with heart disease or high blood pressure, or who take certain medications, such as for depression, insomnia, or poor circulation, may be affected by extreme heat.</li>
<li>Visit adults at risk at least twice a day and closely watch them for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Infants and young children, of course, need much more frequent watching.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adjust to the Environment. </strong>Be aware that any sudden change in temperature, such as an early summer heat wave, will be stressful to your body. You will have a greater tolerance for heat if you limit your physical activity until you become accustomed to the heat. If you travel to a hotter climate, allow several days to become acclimated before attempting any vigorous exercise, and work up to it gradually.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Leave Children in Cars. </strong>Even in cool temperatures, cars can heat up to dangerous temperatures very quickly. Even with the windows cracked open, interior temperatures can rise almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit within the first 10 minutes. Anyone left inside is at risk for serious heat-related illnesses or even death. Children who are left unattended in parked cars are at greatest risk for heat stroke, and possibly death. When traveling with children, remember to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never leave infants, children or pets in a parked car, even if the windows are cracked open.</li>
<li>To remind yourself that a child is in the car, keep a stuffed animal in the car seat.  When the child is buckled in, place the stuffed animal in the front of the driver.</li>
<li>When leaving your car, check to be sure everyone is out of the car.  Do not overlook any children who have fallen asleep in the car.</li>
</ul>

<p>Severe weather has given the grid a walloping over the past few years.  For example, three years ago, parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2009_Central_Plains_and_Midwest_ice_storm" target="_blank">Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Illinois, West Virginia and Missouri</a> suffered through 3 weeks sans power after a record-setting ice storm. Last summer, people in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012_North_American_derecho" target="_blank">Washington, DC</a> metropolitan area were without power for a week during a heat wave as the result of a severe thunderstorm accompanied by high winds.   And most recently, of course, we have witnessed the plight of the victims of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy" target="_blank">Hurricane Sandy</a> as they have struggled to function in the most populated area in the United States without electricity and running water, all while attempting to clean up the detritus of the massive storm.  Three months later, nearly 2000 families are still living in homes without power, through the frigid winter months.</p>
<p>Mother Nature could have other tricks up her sleeve with the possibility of a solar flare-related <span style="text-decoration: underline;">coronal mass ejection</span> that could cause not only outages but irreparable damage to items powered by electricity.  Many countries have developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMP_weapon" target="_blank">EMP (electromagnetic pulse) weapons</a> that could perpetrate the same type of damage.</p>
<p>Yet another grim possibility is that as the economy continues to degrade, more and more people simply <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/what-if-electricity-was-only-for-rich-people_102012" target="_blank">won&#8217;t be able to afford to keep the electricity on</a> in their homes.</p>
<p>However it happens, whether it&#8217;s for 3 weeks or for the long haul, we need to learn to function differently than we do right now.  We need to reduce our dependency on municipally delivered power and either create our own power or simplify to the extent that we need less power.</p>
<p>Many preppers spend hundreds, to even thousands, of dollars on <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/generators/buying-guide.htm" target="_blank">generators</a>.  Most of these are powered by gasoline, although some are fueled by propane.  These investments would certainly be handy during a short term outage but are they really worth the money? This really depends on two things: your ability to store fuel and your budget.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>If you live in suburbia, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll be able to have hundreds of gallons of gasoline stored in a shed in the back yard &#8211; not only will regulations prohibit this, but there simply won&#8217;t be the space on a typical in-town property.</li>
<li>Will purchasing a generator mean that you have to sacrifice other things in your prepping budget?  Will you still have enough food to get through an extended supply emergency?  Will you be able to afford a water filtration system?  What about first aid supplies, seeds, books and home defense items?</li>
</ol>
<p>The next consideration is the probable length of the emergency. Many people in New York and New Jersey had generators, but only enough gasoline for 2-3 days.  Who can forget the<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/shock-72-hours-after-grid-down-starvation-supply-shortages-food-lines-no-clean-water-no-gas-transportation-standstill-independent-reports-pics-and-video_11012012" target="_blank"> long line</a>s where people waited for hours to only be allowed to purchase 5 gallons of gasoline?  Depending on the generator and what appliances are being powered, 5 gallons will supply 3-8 hours of electricity. When you do the math, in the event of a long-term emergency complete with fuel shortages, a gasoline generator is not going to be a long-term solution for most.</p>
<p>Other options (I have not researched these methods because they are currently out of reach for me, so I can&#8217;t go into detail on the pros and cons) are solar power, wind power and harnessing the energy of nearby running water.  Consider your environment before investing in these systems in order to purchase the one that will be most in line with the area in which you live.</p>
<p>So what can you do?  If you can&#8217;t afford to have an off-grid electrical system installed at your home, does this mean that you are destined for an over-crowded shelter, or worse, doomed to failure in the event of a down-grid situation?</p>
<p>NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p>This just means you have to adapt your requirements.</p>
<p>First, check things out at your home or retreat.  Make a list of the items that you use every day that require electrical power.</p>
<p>Then, look at your list and scratch off the items that are absolutely unnecessary &#8211; the television, the video game console, the microwave in the kitchen, etc.  Some families, my own included, have already simplified and gotten rid of these items.</p>
<p>See what you have left.  Of these items, how can you supply your needs without electrical power?  Here are some examples from my family&#8217;s list and the solutions that we either have or have planned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lights</span></em></strong><em>:  Solar garden lights, candles, kerosene lights</em></li>
<li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heat</span></em></strong><em>: Wood stove, small propane heater for the bathroom or kitchen for the coldest days, 2 large canisters of propane</em></li>
<li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cooking</span></em></strong><em>: Wood stove, nutritious home-canned meals that only require reheating, small and large cast-iron Dutch ovens to use on the wood stove, sun oven, outdoor fireplace</em></li>
<li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Refrigeration</span></em></strong><em>: Large cooler to be packed with snow in the winter and used indoors, a plastic storage bench that is lockable to be used outdoors in the winter (the lock is to keep 4 legged critters out of it), root cellar for summer, change of eating habits in summer</em></li>
<li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water</span></em></strong><em>:  (our well runs on an electric pump and we rent, so unfortunately we can&#8217;t modify this) 1 month supply of drinking water stored, Berkey water filtration system, buckets along with a sled or wheel barrow depending on the season, for bringing up water from the lake for flushing, filtration and cleaning.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else, we can really live without.  These are the things which are vital, and the solutions are all long-term.</p>
<p>Now, apply this to your own situation.  Find as many solutions as possible for the issues you would face if going for weeks (or longer) without power.  You must stay warm, eat, and drink.  Everything else is a bonus.</p>
<p>Some people like to give arguments as to why they can&#8217;t resolve these issues.  They live in an apartment, they rent, they have a limited budget&#8230;.the list is as long as indefinite detention.  The fact is, by realizing these things are necessary and refusing to face them and find solutions for your particular situation, you are setting your family up to suffer, and possibly even die, when it could be avoided.</p>
<p>I like electricity. I like the convenience of turning on a light at the switch, of putting ice cubes in my water in the summer and watching a movie after making popcorn on the stove.  But will I die without those things? No.  Anything electrical that is vital to life has a back-up.

No close shopping malls. No more coffee house chocolaty-mocha latte’ frou-frou drinks. No quaint little dress boutiques to pop into to shop the latest styles. I missed them all terribly. And I missed the dressing up part too – okay the shoes. It was the end of my world as I knew it.</p>
<p>All in all though the move wasn’t so bad, after all the reason I chose Western North Carolina as my destination of choice was to be close to my parents; themselves homesteaders of sorts, to learn how to live this new “self-reliant” lifestyle by watching as they performed skills handed down to them by their parents; and their parents before them.</p>
<p>For the first nine (9) months I watched intently; asking questions along the way, as my mom canned, preserved and cooked from scratch (none of which I did in my er …“other” world – especially the cooking part). I also watched as my dad gardened, harvested and worked with his hand-tools; choosing to manually fix things with odds and ends he’d collected throughout the years opposed to going out and replacing them. My dad; as with a lot of dads, had always said that anything in life worth having was worth working hard for. And he did – they did. No short-cuts. That was just how things were done with my parents &#8211; you worked hard for them.</p>
<p>For me, being with my parents was like being at a personal “heritage skills” camp. Me watching as my parents did what came natural to them. My mother the oldest of her siblings didn’t want her children to have the upbringing that she had; cooking, cleaning and caring for her younger siblings while her parents worked. She wanted us to enjoy life, get a good education and make something of ourselves. And, well I can honestly say I did enjoy life – never realizing it could work against me some day.</p>
<p>One beautiful sunny day my parents were driving into town (that’s what people in rural areas call going grocery shopping or to personal appointments) &#8211; out of nowhere a person late for an appointment ran a stop sign at a high rate of speed and broadsided my parent’s vehicle killing my dad instantly. Their vehicle was then shoved across the street and into a telephone pole killing my mom. Both parents were taken instantly &#8211; as was their knowledge. The end of my world as I knew it had once again come. It was now up to me. No more leaning on my parents’ skills and knowledge.  I knew if I was going to survive yet another ‘end of my world as I knew it’ I was going to have to work hard – really hard. Sure, it would have been easier to pack-up and go back to the life I had given up but with that decision would come all those uncertainties &#8211; what if there was a devaluation of the dollar?; what if I couldn’t buy groceries?; what if there was a catastrophe causing major traffic gridlocked? (After all there is only one way out of Florida); and, what if there was civil unrest?  In my heart I knew the choice I made to live a more self-reliant lifestyle was the right one. I just had to take what my parents had shown me and put it to work.  Oh and another thing …that day was the first time in nine months that I had not been behind the wheel driving my parents into town.</p>
<p>Can I say it’s been easy? No; far from it. But like dad said, anything in life worth having was worth working hard for.  And I am. I’m learning and doing new things every day.</p>
<p>It’s been three years since my parents were taken. I now grind my own grains to bake breads. I can and dehydrate my harvested fruits and veggies from my garden (I’ll save those stories for a later time!). I milk my goats to make cheese, yogurt and ice-cream and gather duck eggs for baking and cooking.</p>
<p>So, in answer to the question, “Has the transition from living in a big city to a small rural town been difficult?”  As I sit out in my gazebo, gazing over the mountain tops; sipping my ‘homemade’ chocolaty-mocha latte’ frou-frou drink, I smile, no this self-reliant lifestyle is good.</p>
<p>I’m now ready for the next end of my world as I know it.</p>

I had a surplus of mesh produce bags and decided to get creative in ways to reuse them.</p>
<p>The next time you are at the store, pay close attention to how many products come in mesh bags: Potatoes, onions, garlic, apples, oranges, popsicles and many more. They come in a variety of sizes ranging from extra small to extra large.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to reuse them and simplify your life at the same time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pot Scrubber</strong> &#8211; Rather than going out spending a few extra dollars from your budget for a new pot scrubber, you can make your own with a produce bag. First, clip the edges of the bag. Then, bunch it together so it looks similar to a bow-tie. Finally, secure it with a zip or twist tie and voilà! This is also a good to use when washing the car. You can scrub the caked on mud or insects on your car.</li>
<li><strong>Compost Worm Collector</strong> &#8211; Those of you who have worm bins know it&#8217;s next to impossible getting all of the worms out of your bin before you collect the compost. The next time you have kitchen scraps, put them in a product bag and secure it with a twist tie. In a few days, the worms will move to where the bag is and eat the kitchen scraps. Once most of the worms are in the bag, place them in their new spot.</li>
<li><strong>Excess Product Storage</strong> &#8211; If you belong to a co-op or have an excess of produce from the garden, these mesh bags can be the perfect answer for storage. Produce like onions, potatoes, and garlic need airflow in order to keep well.</li>
<li><strong>Carry all</strong> &#8211; These bags are also great for reusing as a storage bag when you go to the store. It is also a great bag to put bath toys in. If you have over sized mesh bags, you can also use them when picking up essential leaves around the yard ato transfer to a garden bed for mulching.</li>
<li><strong>Loofah</strong> &#8211; Do you have a bunch of small or broken soap bits left over from your bars of soap? Put them in a mesh bag and tie in a knot. The next time you&#8217;re in the shower, use it as a loofah to soften skin. It can also be used to clean dirty garden tools,  or dirty hands for that matter after working in the garden or if your hands are dirty from working on engines.</li>
</ol>
<div>Next time you have extra mesh produce bags, save them up for future uses. They definitely have more than just one use.</div>
