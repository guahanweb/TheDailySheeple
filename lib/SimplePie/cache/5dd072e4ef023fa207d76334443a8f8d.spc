<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">August 27, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:x-large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">If you&#8217;ve ever studied infomercials, you know the whole business is based on back-end sales. It&#8217;s not the product you buy for $19.95, it&#8217;s the products they can hook you into after you spend the $19.95.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">So it is with Google Glass. It&#8217;s all about the apps that&#8217;ll be attached. .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Glass gives the wearer short-hand reality as he taps in. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for. The user is “on the go.” If he&#8217;s driving his Lexus and suddenly thinks about Plato, he&#8217;s not going to download the full text of The Republic to mull while he&#8217;s crashing into big trucks on the Jersey Turnpike. He&#8217;s going to take a shorthand summary. A few lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">People want boiled-down info while they&#8217;re on the move. Reduction. The “essentials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">This is perfectly in line with the codes of the culture. Ads, quick-hitter seminars, headlines, two-sentence summaries, ratings for products, news with no context. Stripped-down, reduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Well, here is a look into right now. A student at Stanford is developing a Google app that “reads other people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">From SFGate, 8/26, “Google Glass being designed to read emotions”: “The [emotion-recognition] tools can analyze facial expressions and vocal patterns for signs of specific emotions: Happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, and more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">This is the work of Catalin Voss, an 18-year-old student at Stanford and his start-up company, Sension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">So you&#8217;re wearing Google Glass at a meeting and it checks out the guy across the table who has an empty expression on his mug and, above your right eye, you see the word “neutral.” Now he smiles, and the word “happy” appears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">I kid you not. This information is supposed to guide you in your communication. The number of things that can go wrong? Count the ways, if you&#8217;re able. I&#8217;m personally looking forward to that guy across the table saying, “Hey, you, schmuck with the Glass, what is your app saying about me now? Angry?” That should certainly enhance the communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Or a husband, just back from his 12-mile morning bike ride, enters his Palo Alto home, wearing Glass, of course, and as he looks at his wife, who is sitting at the kitchen table reading a book, sees the word “sad” appear above his eye. “Honey,” he says, recalling the skills he picked up in a 26- minute webinar, “have you been pursuing a negative line of thinking?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">She slowly gazes up at the goggle-eyed monster in his spandex and grasshopper helmet, rises from her chair and tosses a plate of hot eggs in his face. YouTube, please!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">But wait. There&#8217;s more. The Glass app is also being heralded as a step forward in “machine-human relationships.” With recognition services like Google Now and Siri, when computers and human users talk to each other, the computers will be able to respond not only to the content of the user&#8217;s words, but also to his tone, his feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">This should be a real marvel. As you&#8217;ve no doubt already realized, the emotion-recognition tool is all about reduction. It shrinks human feelings to simplistic labels. Therefore, what machines say back to humans will be something to behold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Machine version of NLP, anyone? I&#8217;m predicting a surge in destroyed computers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The astonishing thing about this new app is that many tech people are so on-board with it. In other words, they believe that human feelings can be broken down and worked with on an androidal basis, with no loss incurred. These people are already boiled down, cartoonized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">You think you&#8217;ve observed predictive programing in movies? That&#8217;s nothing. The use of apps like this one will help bring about a greater willingness on the part of humans to reduce their own thoughts and feelings to&#8230;FIT THE SPECS OF THE MACHINES AND THE SOFTWARE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Count on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">This isn&#8217;t really about machines acting more like humans. It&#8217;s about humans acting like machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The potential range of human emotions is extraordinary. Our language, when used with imagination, actually extends that range. It&#8217;s something called art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The counter-trend is in gear. No matter how subtle the emotion-recognition algorithms become, there will always be a wide, wide gap between what they produce and the expression of humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The most profound kind of mind control seeks to eliminate that gap by encouraging us to mimic technology. That means people will think and feel less, and what they think and feel will mean less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The machines won&#8217;t say, “I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t identify that emotion, it&#8217;s too complex.” They&#8217;ll say “sad” or “happy” or “upset” or whatever they have to say to give the appearance that they&#8217;re on top of the human condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Eventually, significant numbers of people will tailor their self-awareness to what the machines point to, name, label, declare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Thus, inventing reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The wolf becomes a lamb, the lamb becomes a flea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">And peace prevails. You can wear it and see with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Eventually, realizing that Glass is too obvious and obnoxious and bulky, companies will develop something they might call Third Eye, a chip the size of half a grain of rice, made flat, and inserted under the skin of the forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Perfect. Invisible. Of course, cops will have them. And talk to them.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">I&#8217;m parked at the corner of Wilshire and Westwood. Suspicious male standing outside the Harmon Building.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">I see him. Searching relevant data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Which means any past arrests, race, conditions noted in his medical records, tax status, questionable statements he&#8217;s made in public or private, significant known associates, group affiliations, etc. And present state of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The cop: “Recommendation?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">Passive-aggressive, right now he&#8217;s peaking at 3.2 on the Hoover Bipolar scale. Bring subject into custody for general questioning.” </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">Will do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">No one will wonder why, because such analysis resonates with the vastly reduced general perception of what reality is all about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">People mimic how machines see them and adjust their human thinking accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Hand and glove, key and lock. Wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">As the cop is transporting the suspect to the station, Third Eye intercedes: “Sorry, Officer Crane, it took me a minute to dig further. Suspect is business associate of REDACTED. This is a catch and release. Repeat, catch and release. Printing out four backstage passes to Third Memorial Rolling Stones concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Apologize profusely, give subject the tickets, and release him immediately.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">I copy.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:x-large;">This arrest and attendant communication is being deleted&#8230;now.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">I have several answers to that question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The people who run the people who run things want to own everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To them, freedom is another thing to own. So they want it. And they want it all for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Second, they realize that people who have freedom will not want the kind of world being lowered on them, and with freedom, those rebels may just find a way to keep the planned future from happening. So&#8230;better to close all doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">All the phony political talk about “we&#8217;re in this together” is a blatant attempt to promote the idea that freedom is a small thing that must be sacrificed. For the greater good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The people who run things from the top believe that freedom can be owned, because they can&#8217;t think of anything that can&#8217;t be owned. That&#8217;s their view. That&#8217;s the way they see life and the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That puts them at a strategic advantage. They focus all their energies on buying and selling. The holdouts among us are those who have values that can&#8217;t be displayed like cars in a showroom. Values that can&#8217;t be argued for in commercial language. Values that are ultimately non-material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Holding the value of freedom gives us one advantage. We&#8217;re not competing against similar products in the marketplace. We&#8217;re competing against one thing only: slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In one way or another, I have been writing about mind control for 30 years. It&#8217;s the doorway into slavery. It&#8217;s an attempt to wipe out everything that freedom means&#8212;most of all, how much it means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Whatever humans can accomplish, the platform for it is liberty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To say that freedom carries too much potential for abuse is like arguing that oceans are too dangerous and should be outlawed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The so-called philosophies that replace freedom try to paint their conclusions with inevitability, and they all fail. From Plato to Marx, they begin with statements of what is possible “if only people would recognize the truth.” Their utopias, when played out, produce tyranny over mind, body, and soul. The cost of perfection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Behind every good thing you or I or anyone has accomplished, there was the space of freedom. It&#8217;s almost a truism, it&#8217;s so obvious. But because it&#8217;s so obvious, we tend to ignore it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Now, strong advocates of freedom are looked upon, by the government, as potentially dangerous people. They are demeaned in every possible way. If that doesn&#8217;t give you a clue about where government is heading, try reading the piece of paper called the Constitution, and then compare the statements in that document with the present scope of government and come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As an aside, try finding a serious college course that does exactly that comparison in great detail. Good luck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Freedom is out; the collective is in.</span></p>

<p><a title="Exit From the Matrix" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3550"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3550" alt="Exit From the Matrix" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/matrix-exit1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Our petty leaders, the dupes and mules for the future over the hill, are humping the ultimate prize, freedom, which they will lay at the feet of their masters. They will do it gladly, because they can sell all the programs and systems and laws and regulations that add up to no-freedom. It&#8217;s easy. They believe it&#8217;s workable. And the less freedom that exists, they more power they, the dupes, have, and the bigger their principalities. They&#8217;re mercenaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s a principle you won&#8217;t find in a college economics course: the free market can only exist when the participants have non-material values that conspire to produce good relations among people. In the absence of that, anything and everything can be bought and sold, including the right to be free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This, of course, ties in with the elite philosophy of ownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If we give up our values, some distant future historian will write: “Those people believed in a myth of great men who had much money, much power. Demi-gods. The demi-gods appeared and approached the people with an offer. Sell us your freedom. What is your price? And the people named a price and the bargain was struck. The people were satisfied. They reasoned that what they were trading was a thing, an item, a kind of product, which, were it not for the demi-gods, could never be sold. In a way, the people were mesmerized by what they had been able to accomplish with that sale. Ironically, they were so deluded because they had allowed themselves to grow fat on freedom&#8230;” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Mind, body, soul, imagination, and love all exist on the basis that freedom is there&#8212;or if it isn&#8217;t, it must be fought for. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">August 25, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The NSA joined the UN in 2012. But they didn&#8217;t go through the usual process. Instead, they hacked in and began bugging UN teleconferences at its New York headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Der Spiegel, based on another Snowden leak, reports, quoting an NSA document: “The data traffic gives us internal video conferencing of the United Nations (yay!)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">We&#8217;re not just talking about General Assembly meetings. NSA had to crack code to get in. Presumably, these were smaller, more private sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Der Speigel also mentions that NSA has been spying on the EU delegation in New York, the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Commission), and 80 embassies and consulates around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">At this point, I&#8217;d normally write something like, “So who hasn&#8217;t the NSA been spying on? You, in your home?” But we already know the Agency is collecting information on all of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is how federal agencies operate. Based on technology at their disposal and budget dollars, they&#8217;ll extend their “mandate” as far as they possibly can. Breaking the law is as important to them as running a red light is to a cop in pursuit of a bank robber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">NSA is supposed to collect information on behalf of “national security.” This now means “all data on everybody all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because their true mission, aligned with that of the federal government, is control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If the FDA had enough funding, they would track every item of food sold in America from farm to store to customer to digestion to elimination, just because they could. ATF would list and track every weapon from the North Pole to Tierra del Fuego. The Dept. of the Interior would label and analyze every inch of soil in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The technicians in these agencies would be thrilled to carry out such tasks. Give them an objective, tell them you want a system, and they&#8217;ll go to it like bloodhounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">When government officials use the word “freedom,” they&#8217;re really saying, “You know, that old fairy tale people used to amuse themselves with.” We have our own clash of civilizations right here at home. It&#8217;s between, on the one side, government and its enabling partners, and on the other side, those of us who still know freedom actually means something. That clash isn&#8217;t going away.</span></p>

<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll find the following statement in a DOD training manual titled, Extremism, just exposed by Judicial Watch:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">In US history, there are many examples of extremist ideologies and movements. The colonists who sought to free themselves from British rule and the Confederate states who sought to secede from the Northern states are just two examples.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, I guess that settles that. The colonists were just a bunch of extremist crazies. No connection to us now. A fringe group of haters. For some reason, they didn&#8217;t like the British.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">One of the crazy colonists penned this quote. You can understand why the federal government of today prefers to think of him and his ilk as extremists:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">When the representative body have lost the confidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands, then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution.” (Thomas Jefferson, 1774)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What would a less extremist mind produce? Something like this: “It is the sworn duty of the government to protect its citizens. In this regard, smashing the walls of privacy in every facet of life is essential. A protected citizen is a known citizen. If he errs, he can be corrected, through persuasion, peer pressure, threat, harassment, arrest and prosecution. A citizen who takes a dim view of government power is a potential terrorist. He is dangerous to the collective. He must be stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yes, that&#8217;s a much more balanced and modern view. A person writing that statement would be given a pass by the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Actually, on a scale of venality, the NSA snooping on the UN ranks fairly low. I just wish the NSA would publish every word of what they&#8217;ve picked up. Then we would see what an infernal organization is headquartered in New York. Spying on one organic farmer in California is far worse than spying on the whole UN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, it shouldn&#8217;t escape your attention that the NSA is an agency formed under the Pentagon. That means the military is spying on everybody in America. The fact that the Pentagon is a section of the Dept. of Defense, which itself is under the control of White House merely indicates the President is doing nothing to stop the military.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">August 22, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The reference here is a January 2013 report funded by the Greenwall Foundation titled: “Enhanced Warfighters: Risk, Ethics, and Policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The report utilized military consultants, and reflects what the National Security State is promoting as “the wave of the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Of course, this is a done deal. Enhancement is already an overall experiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is a key quote from the report: “&#8230;cognitive and physical enhancements aim to create a super-soldier from a biomedical direction, such as with drugs and bionics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This indicates pharmaceutical attempts to increase endurance, focus, and pain threshold, but also to alter states of mind: mood, emotional range (restricted), attitude (controlled, stepped up aggression).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Whatever mad chemists can fantasize about&#8212;for instance, the boosting of leadership traits&#8212;they&#8217;ll try to induce it in the lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Bionics, of course, means the replacement of body parts with machines. This would function as repair, in the case of wounds, but robotic devices would be installed simply because they work better than flesh. In which case, we can look forward to replacement as a general strategy&#8212;without the prior need for wounds.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Listen, soldier, if we give you a new eye, you&#8217;ll be able to spot an enemy combatant at five hundred yards&#8230;and this miniaturized transmitter can be joined to your brain so you can receive commands directly from headquarters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">With utter frankness, the Greenwall report continues: “For battle, we want our soft organic bodies to perform more like machines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This statement leaves no doubts about intentions. It also suggests that the number of bionic replacements per soldier isn&#8217;t limited. The goal is effective performance, come hell or high water, whatever it takes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There&#8217;s more: “Somewhere in between robotics and biomedical research, we might arrive at the perfect future warfighter: one that is part machine and part human, striking a formidable balance between technology and our frailties.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Why not call these soldiers human drones? Launched from command central, mission orders stored in their brains, operated remotely, their capabilities completely understood as elements of a program, the soldiers would fulfill the military meaning of war: complete victory as a function of underlying algorithms, regardless of the human cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is the eternal wet dream of the war-makers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It also happens to be the environment of video games. Therefore, volunteers should be plentiful.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re only giving me one new arm and an enhanced ear? I was hoping for more. What about my brain? What can you do for me there?”</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">For those who still wonder whether the famed CIA MKULTRA mind control program of the 1950s continued after the announced cut-off date, your question is answered. Coerced brain and behavioral conditioning is at the core of creating the super-soldier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Think about the money. The military can&#8217;t afford to risk trillions of dollars on pharmaceutical enhancement and body-part replacement, without also controlling the thoughts, responses, and actions of its high-priced personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Technocrats are surely lining up, at the Pentagon, to provide this all-important MKULTRA element of warfare.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Hi Mom. I&#8217;m home from the theater of operations. Don&#8217;t worry, I may look different with all these new enhancements, but I&#8217;m still your son. By the way, the girls love the new parts! And the Army spent $30 million on me! I&#8217;m very valuable! Oh&#8230;one little thing. If while we&#8217;re talking, I suddenly shut down or begin talking to someone who isn&#8217;t in the room, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s business. What&#8217;s for supper?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Finally, consider this. An all-out operation to transhumanize the military could not take place unless there is absolute dedication to fighting wars without end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You don&#8217;t re-build humans for a future of skirmishes or peace treaties. </span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The year is 2034. You&#8217;re hacking into a classified syndicate broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">First you see a thick grove of pine trees, then a watering hole where a pack of wolves gather. Behind them are simul rows of infantry wearing black masks studded with silver sensors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This gives way to a page of deep blue sky and white stars. A voice emerges: </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">As I was saying before the riots interrupted us, we&#8217;re in good shape. The dopes are still buying reality. In fact, they&#8217;re more hungry for it than ever.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Our surveys show a growing subset of addicts who are absolutely devoted to the Church of the Polite. In one experiment, we gave them a placebo. They went away grinning like idiots.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Injections cause the full blossoming of a perceptual field filled with people, events, memory. Who knows what there was before? NOW is all that&#8217;s important. Take your shot and live a new life.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">WAIT A MINUTE. I&#8217;m showing a disruption of the consensus field in Sector 4-A-12, Los Angeles. It&#8217;s fluctuating, blinking out. Search underway for a source. An alt.reality-construction is occurring. Command: Go live with primary blocking program. Alt.reality-construction expanding in downtown, north of Olympic Boulevard. Blocking program fizzled.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Crowds moving on to Olympic. They&#8217;re seeing the alt.reality! Drone strike called. Spraying aerosol vaccine to restore consensus field&#8230;no effect. Our agents are on the scene. We&#8217;re flying holographic banners: “THIS IS A LIE.” No effect so far.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The alt. reality is coming in stronger now. It&#8217;s based on emotional sensation. Effluence of FREEDOM. Drones releasing Roundup, Paraquat&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You leave your cellar apartment on Hoover Street, fight your way through a flank of buzzing subliminals, and hit Wilshire. DHS troops are setting up a roadblock at Vermont Avenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The underlying principle of the whole op: DON&#8217;T LET THE PEOPLE BE AS CONSCIOUS AS THEY CAN BE, AND DON&#8217;T LET THEM LIVE AND ACT FROM THAT CONSCIOUSNESS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You head north through Lafayette Park and a blast of alt.reality from downtown crumbles the consensus field in front of you. You&#8217;re not in the park anymore. You&#8217;re walking through your own mind. You&#8217;re moving along a corridor next to a bookstore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You now see your mind as a series of apartments and corridors. Two floors are devoted to EMPTY NEUTRALITY. You break down an apartment door. A heavy sleep machine is pumping out perfumed air. You almost go under.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You take the stairs down to ground level and see an apartment with an open door. You walk in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s a large hall filled with people. At the front, the President is making a speech. The people are laughing. With each new statement he makes, the laughter grows louder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You go back into the corridor and walk swiftly toward the end, which is floor-to-ceiling open window.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a title="Exit From the Matrix" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3550"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3550" alt="Exit From the Matrix" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/matrix-exit1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Reaching it, you look down at a city spread out before you. It&#8217;s Los Angeles, but something is missing. You can identify streets, buildings, neighborhoods, but something that is always there isn&#8217;t there now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You stand at the window for a long time. Finally, it dawns on you. There is no hatred in the city. It&#8217;s gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">How is that possible?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A wave of fear sweeps through you. Has it been artificially removed? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Somehow you know the people themselves have emerged out of a cocoon of synthetically and externally broadcast hatred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In its place is a&#8230;quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Islands of alt.realities, in the form of wide percolating streaks of energy, are sweeping through the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The energies are emanating from&#8230;people. It&#8217;s theirs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">August 22, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re an unemployed artist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The year is 2044. A series of bombings has rocked the Capitol in the Western White House District, which is located in the heart of Hollywood. The Eastern seaboard is now uninhabitable, owing to a mysterious Monsanto accident, which rendered all plant life in that region poisonous&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Reality is a nasty syndicate operation. The technical side is put together by high-IQ idiots. They like to fiddle. They like the con. They like to torpedo the mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The syndicate is the Reality Manufacturing Company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You buy a ticket to Disneyland, which encompasses the area from San Francisco to Tijuana, go through the big gate, and soon find out there&#8217;s no exit. At least you&#8217;re relatively safe. You book a small hotel room in Aspartame Village. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A note is taped to the back of the toilet, where you&#8217;ve been told to look. It&#8217;s unsigned. You read it while you&#8217;re preparing supper: powdered eggs, water, and a squirt of SweetHeaven: </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Greetings, GuestL28vi35. This to warn you the pillars of the community, the people who are supposed to be &#8216;doing good,&#8217; are up to their necks in the operation. They&#8217;re hustling reality like porn.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">At the upper levels, we&#8217;ve even got the STE Command, peddling the space-time-energy continuum everyone is so fond of. Only one tin can and we&#8217;re all in it, biological machines &#8216;doing our best to get along.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Until recently, there was a sense that artists knew something about all this and were exposing the Company. But now, propaganda is eating into their psyches, or their work isn&#8217;t finding the light of day Some have been conned into high-flying rhetoric about saving humanity and working together to build a better world inside the prevailing political framework. There is no better world inside the prevailing political framework.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s just another hustle. Cheap salesmen on the job. &#8216;Here, let me try this pair of shoes on you. I think you&#8217;ll like them a lot&#8230;they&#8217;re supposed to feel tight, otherwise, the design doesn&#8217;t work.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The artist should be ripping away masks, exposing the Company employees. Adorning some fake religion promoted by the State, like the current MaR24tc, isn&#8217;t his job.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But he&#8217;s promoting peace these days as if it were a little magic stone you rub. Or a gold fairy worm inside a gourd you shake. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Overthrowing the reality-con is the work of the artist. He&#8217;s got to take to it like a duck to water. He has to like it. He has to use his weapons, all of them. He has to build bigger towers than the Company.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Lately, have you noticed people asking you, &#8216;Are you coming from a place of anger or love?&#8217; First of all, &#8216;coming from a place of&#8217; is psycho-op lingo. It&#8217;s fake wisdom for the kiddies (adults whose development has been arrested in the Oprah-phase). I personally am coming from a lot of different places, including San Diego. It&#8217;s a town populated by many androids. They&#8217;ve learned to affect a pose of happiness because frankly they don&#8217;t know what else to do. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I bring this up because it&#8217;s another Company op. Goes like this: find a place &#8216;to come from,&#8217; and then make your existence an emotional bumper sticker. REDUCTION.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s exactly what the syndicate wants. It opposes proliferation because it can&#8217;t profile it. The Matrix is built on the need to reduce thought. Reduction inevitably leads to whining and complaining. Then props called spiritual leaders emerge out of the woodwork and offer to solve the complaints. But they never can (even if they wanted to), because the original problem remains. REDUCTION.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Our glorious New Age, so-called, is exactly that: THOUGHT REDUCTION. It fails, and the aftermath is ugly. People become contortionists and end up eating their own livers. They don&#8217;t even know how to season them. They take it straight.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You might be wondering who I am. I&#8217;m from the Movable Underground Museum. You&#8217;ve probably heard of it. The Company calls us dangerous because we&#8217;ve found a way to dismantle their product.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I can&#8217;t give you details in an open message. Keep your eyes open. We show up here and there. You&#8217;ll know. So far, we&#8217;ve laid out two new universes. They&#8217;re empty. Lots of room for adventurous souls. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s something else to keep your eye on, too. The Company&#8217;s reality is breaking down. You may see seams in odd places where there shouldn&#8217;t be any. Don&#8217;t pick at them or point them out to other people. You&#8217;ll get busted for that. A seam is usually a long thin blue line. If it pops far enough, you&#8217;ll see a different kind of space behind it. Stay calm.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">For the past two weeks, a big seam has been exposed at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. Don&#8217;t try to go there. Crowds were gathering. The DHS came in and hosed them down with a version of Roundup. Upwards of six thousand people were arrested, and DHS has the area cordoned off with tanks.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If you can still pick up SubNetB8 on your mobile device, you can see pictures. The white light streaming through the gap in the seam? It&#8217;s been photoshopped in. It isn&#8217;t really there. Neither are the UFOs or the voices. That&#8217;s the Company. They&#8217;re staging a &#8216;virtual drill&#8217; in the area. Lots of phony religious content. It&#8217;s a cover. They&#8217;ve built a temp church in Silver Lake to handle the overflow of new believers.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If somebody approaches you with an offer to travel to Mexico, then sneak back into the US and apply for benefits, don&#8217;t bite. Tomorrow morning, before nine, walk to the Mickey Pavilion, turn left and keep going for about a mile. On your right, you&#8217;ll see a small shed painted green. Behind the shed is a cheap water ride. Take out a boat and row to the Secret Tunnel.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Take it. When the little train has been in the tunnel for a minute, you&#8217;ll see a dim corridor on your left. Hop off the train and walk along the corridor. You&#8217;ll come to the back of the Clinton-Bush-Obama Mountain. At the base is a service door. It&#8217;s unlocked.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Go through and you&#8217;ll be standing on the corner of Ashbury Street and First Avenue. A day&#8217;s walk east will take you out into the desert. The fences are broken. Get out into the desert and head toward the Nevada Hills. You&#8217;ll see it. It&#8217;s a huge white hotel about five miles in.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">A mile before the hotel, you&#8217;ll come to a wide crack in the desert floor. It&#8217;s not a crack. The Company&#8217;s Simul is breaking down there. It&#8217;s an exit. Use it if you have the courage.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">You burn the note, sit and eat your powdered eggs and watch the news. You think about what you&#8217;re going to do. Or not do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A few sentences float in from somewhere. They were written by Philip K Dick, an ancient writer whose works have been outlawed: </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><i>Because today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups…So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms&#8230;And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.”</i></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"><span style="font-size:large;">www.nomorefakenews.com</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If you still remember a piece of paper called the US Constitution, you might wonder under what section of that document the government is permitted to alter the human species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A current Pentagon plan to create a biological platform inside the human body, using it to deliver new genetic information, and thus changing what the human body is and does&#8230;well, that is about as outrageous as you can get, when it comes to the violation of permitted federal powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Yet, the White House doesn&#8217;t care, nor does Congress, nor does the Supreme Court, nor does any federal agency or oversight department. It&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s not a problem. It&#8217;s a “medical” program, you see. And therefore it will help people, and the government&#8217;s job is to help people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This is the new version of the Constitution: “the government is here to help you, and anything it does in that regard is legal.” Sign up now. Get on the list. Help overrides anything written into the Constitution.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If the government wants to help me, it&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s what government is for. It&#8217;s like a parent. If the daddy is injecting me with genetic material to make me better, I love it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is preparing to launch these genetic experiments. DARPA is organized under the Pentagon, which is organized under the Dept, of Defense, which is an agency of the executive branch, which means the White House, which refers to the President, where the buck stops. So that&#8217;s the chain of command. The violation of the Constitution goes all the way to the top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here is a key quote from the DARPA proposal: <i>“…the successful development of technologies for rapid introduction of large DNA vectors into human cell lines will enable the ability to engineer much more complex functionalities into human cell lines than are currently possible.”</i> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">DARPA plans to insert a 47</span><sup><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size:large;"> chromosome into human cell lines. That chromosome will serve as a kind of platform that will make subsequent delivery of new genetic information much easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">New genetic information means alterations in the body, at the level of DNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Engineering humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><i>(For a pdf copy of the DARPA solicitation in question &#8212; which is entitled &#8220;<i>Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering</i>&#8220;, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://nomorefakenews.com/dir666/darpa_advanced-tools-for-mammalian-genome-engineering_copy.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a></span></span>.)</i></span></p>

<p><a title="The Matrix Revealed" href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-mp3s-pdfs-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" alt="The Matrix Revealed" src="http://jonrappoport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/matrixrevealed3.jpg?w=640"   /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">DARPA will justify these experiments on the basis of improving soldiers&#8217; performance on the battlefield, their general health, their capacity to recover from illness, injury, exhaustion. They can justify it any way they want to, but it adds up to the same thing. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We will change you. We will make you better. And, ahem, uh, easier to control.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But this isn&#8217;t a debate about how a human could be made better or what “better” should mean or who should decide. It&#8217;s an argument that the whole program is a violation of the Constitution&#8212;because if we don&#8217;t stand on that, we don&#8217;t stand on anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Without invoking the law of the land, we allow various people to squabble about lesser issues and determine outcomes based on random and arbitrary factors.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, I don&#8217;t think the Pentagon should be in charge of this program at all. It should be moved over to the National Institutes of Health, where it belongs.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I see no problem with Pentagon handling it, as long as there is civilian oversight from, say, the FDA. We could also have university scientists act in a consulting capacity&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">The President should appoint a Genetics Czar. He could supervise the whole thing, with Congressional oversight.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It has to be run by the government. Otherwise, we can&#8217;t guarantee it&#8217;ll be done in an ethical fashion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">No. The whole effort to engineer humans is unconstitutional, where government involvement is concerned. As for private companies taking part, there are already laws on the books about engineering humans. The adequate enforcement of those laws is another problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">There&#8217;s nothing much at stake here. Only the future of the human species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If private citizens, who are the target of this experimentation, don&#8217;t have standing to file a class action suit against the government, who does? A judge denying standing would, in and of itself, create an uproar. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Let me see if I&#8217;ve got this straight, Your Honor. We, as private citizens, who would have our DNA changed, don&#8217;t have the right to object. Correct? Call us crazy, but we thought potential victims are precisely the class who must take action. Who should oppose this program? Ants? Rats? Chimpanzees?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If there are any constitutional lawyers out there who see what&#8217;s happening here, I advise immediate filings. Take this horror to the most basic level: the gross violation of federal powers. Bury the government where they stand. Make the point. Cut this off at the pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If there is any issue around which the American people should be able to unite, the government alteration of their genes should be it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If not, I suggest consulting travel brochures for other planets.</span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes. A whole lot of poems, in fact.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What?! Impossible. That has to be a mistake. I&#8217;m just an ordinary guy. I go to work, have a few beers, take the train home, eat dinner, read the paper, do a little note-writing on experiments at the lab, go to bed around midnight&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Jim, I&#8217;m not asking for your biography&#8212;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I know, Doc, but what you&#8217;re telling me is crazy. I like a limerick now and then, but the weird stuff&#8230;Shakespeare and Milton&#8230;that&#8217;s for the dome heads. I&#8217;m just&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re a regular guy. Got that, Jim. However, I can show you X-rays. Scans. There&#8217;s poetry in your brain, and it&#8217;s threatening to take over your cerebral cortex unless we go in and do a second surgery.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Take over? You&#8217;re joking.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You have to face up to a few things, Jimbo. You&#8217;re actually posing as just another Joe, and it&#8217;s a good impression, I&#8217;m sure, but inside you there are poems waiting to come out. And if they do, it&#8217;s going to get ugly, believe me. For one thing, you&#8217;ll see more.”</span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">THERE ISN&#8217;T ANYTHING MORE. There&#8217;s what I do every day. My work. My family. My salary. Beers with the boys. Football. I love football.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes, we all love football, Jim. It&#8217;s mandatory. But you&#8230;let me read one of the poems we found in your brain.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">HELL NO.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It won&#8217;t hurt that much.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I don&#8217;t want to hear it.”</span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Okay, Jim, take it easy, it&#8217;s in </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>your</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> head, don&#8217;t blame me. We&#8217;ve discovered that&#8230;how I can put this&#8230;on some level you&#8217;re always thinking in poetry. Your whole consciousness is involved, and if we were to take the poems away, you&#8217;d go into a deep sleep, a kind of amnesia, perhaps a coma, and you&#8217;d never wake up. So we can&#8217;t surgically remove the poems. At best we can bury them deeper.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Do it. Bury them. Bury them all.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes, Jim, but hear me out. If we do that, you&#8217;ll lose something.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You mean I won&#8217;t like football anymore?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No, Jim. You&#8217;ll still have football. But you might not have beer. Just kidding. Ha-ha. What you might lose is your interest in life.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You may not feel alive in the same way. You could become very dull.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">How&#8217;s that possible, Doc. You&#8217;re just getting rid of poems. Who cares?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well, Jim, apparently you do. As much as you&#8217;d like to deny it, your existence, your feeling about what it means to be alive&#8212;even though you&#8217;re trying to emphasize how ordinary you are&#8212;is wrapped up in a certain poetic consciousness. I know, it&#8217;s strange. But again, don&#8217;t blame me.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Look, Doc, you went into my skull to remove some kind of little blockage. And then you came up with these poems. And now you want to bury them. But you say if you do, I might turn into a zombie.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">In the surgery, Jim, there was a leakage. Poems started to come through. We put in a plug, but it&#8217;s just temporary. It&#8217;s a delicate situation. Going back in a second time, we either let out all the poems, or we build a thicker wall.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Let me ask you a question, Doc. This thing, consciousness. What is it?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s two things, Jim. It&#8217;s what makes you know you&#8217;re alive, and it&#8217;s also how you&#8217;re alive. That second part is tricky. You&#8217;re alive, Jim, through connecting with the rhythm and sound of certain thoughts, certain energies. And these energies would NEVER come through to you if it weren&#8217;t for language, and that language is poetic. It&#8217;s much greater than the reality we see around us. You dampen down that language, Jim, because you want to appear normal. It&#8217;s your goal in life, to pretend not to understand anything about this. Do you see? You want to come off like a regular guy, who&#8217;s smart and good at his job, and who knows what&#8217;s happening in the world. But you don&#8217;t want to admit you&#8217;re connected to&#8230;that thing you&#8217;re afraid of.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But LOOK. I AM a regular guy. All right, so I read the newspaper and I can look behind the stories and I can see a lot of the con games the government is playing on people. I can see crimes and conspiracies. I know something about who&#8217;s running the show, who&#8217;s behind the curtain. I take pride in that. But this poetry thing. It&#8217;s crazy.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Yes, I understand, Jim. But that&#8217;s not going to cut it in this case. We&#8217;re at a serious crossroad. We have to do something. You&#8217;re playing with fire, trying to deny your connection. On some level, you&#8217;re participating in a greater reality. You&#8217;re thinking on a different plane, and that thinking is what we call poetry. We could call it Budweiser, but it wouldn&#8217;t make any difference. It&#8217;s thought with higher force. It&#8217;s great and grand ideas. And they&#8217;re coming from you, from your mind. You want to say you&#8217;re living in a pond, but you&#8217;re living in the ocean. Let me put it this way. If you weren&#8217;t accessing oceanic consciousness, you couldn&#8217;t step it all down and appear to be a normal very smart guy. It wouldn&#8217;t work. You&#8217;d have nothing to dampen down.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What would I be?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">A broccoli. A head of lettuce.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re serious?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">As serious as an aneurism, Jim.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Geez, Doc, this is bad. My whole reputation, my whole rep with MYSELF is riding on the fact that I&#8217;m a hardheaded realist. Do you get what&#8217;s at stake here?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Of course I do. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m being so forthcoming. I could have put you under without you knowing it and just cut into your skull again. But I wanted to explain the whole thing to you and give you a choice. You see, Jim, the truth is we&#8217;re all living in a charade. We&#8217;re all faking it. We&#8217;re pretending we don&#8217;t have these fantastic energies in us. We&#8217;re all stepping it down to average and normal and smart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It just so happens that, by the luck of the draw, my assistant in the OR nicked a little piece of your brain and opened up a portal into what we&#8217;re all trying to avoid. We&#8217;re all hooked up to our own poetic centers. We all see life in much wider and deeper terms. I don&#8217;t mean little stupid rhymes. I mean great language that vaults us up into atmospheres and spaces that&#8230;well, I can&#8217;t really do it justice sitting here talking to you. But this is mind control here, Jim. The most profound kind. Self-induced. We do it to ourselves. We cut off access. We keep ourselves ignorant about the language we have&#8230;the genuine language that comes out of imagination. If I operate on you again, there&#8217;s a chance the wall we build will be too thick, and you&#8217;ll wake up with very little awareness. You&#8217;ll be regular and normal and average for real. And trust me, Jim, that&#8217;s a nightmare. I&#8217;ve seen it. The person is, to put it kindly, at an enormous disadvantage.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">What should I do, Doc?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Take a chance, Jim. Let us clear away any scar tissue and just leave an open portal. Let the language and the energies come through. From one faker to another, go for it. Go for the great adventure. Who knows what&#8217;ll it be? One thing&#8217;s for sure. You won&#8217;t be sitting here whining to me. You&#8217;ll be you. Dealing with that won&#8217;t be easy, but with enough guts, you could make it through. You could show us what we don&#8217;t want to see.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Doesn&#8217;t sound very appealing.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That won&#8217;t be your problem, Jim. I guarantee it. The problem is, it&#8217;ll be too appealing.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Sounds dangerous.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I wouldn&#8217;t put it that way. Being who you are is what you&#8217;ve sacrificed your whole life. You&#8217;re going to retract that sacrifice. Think of it that way. You&#8217;re going to pull away the sacrifice like an old coat and burn it in the fire of a thousand new suns&#8230;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Or else come back as a carrot.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Pretty much. People around you will still think you&#8217;re Jim, but inside you won&#8217;t be anybody or anything. You&#8217;ll be a robot with no real consciousness.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I hate poetry, Doc.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why do you think that is, Jim?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I don&#8217;t know. I want things to be simple and clear. Like a story. Beginning, middle, end.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Wrapped up like a nice neat package.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s right.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Like your life.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Why not?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You tell me.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I hate poetry.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We all do, Jim. It reminds us of something we&#8217;d rather forget.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">So help me forget it, Doc.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You want to be a zombie.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If that&#8217;s what it takes.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Imagine a world full of zombies, Jim. Everybody cut off from their oceanic consciousness. No poetry ever again.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Sounds good. Sounds like realism. No more conflict. No more demons.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Demons? Is that what you think I&#8217;m talking about, Jim? Your greatest thoughts and energies expressed with their greatest force, with raw beauty and&#8212;”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">They&#8217;re not RATIONAL, Doc. They&#8217;re meaningless. I don&#8217;t understand those thoughts. They don&#8217;t make any sense.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">If we build that wall in your brain, Jim, what&#8217;s left of you will be a machine. Do you get that?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">That&#8217;s what I want. I want to be a machine. I&#8217;ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Well&#8230;okay, kid. Your choice. Your destiny. We&#8217;ll prep you for surgery. We&#8217;ll make those trillion watts of energy shrink down to a ten-watt bulb.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">This thing you call poetic consciousness, Doc? It&#8217;s just a delusion. And I want to get rid of it.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Okay, Jim, I&#8217;ll put the genie back in the bottle.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Nice talking to you, Doc.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">I wish that were true, Jim. TYGER, TYGER, BURNING BRIGHT, IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT, WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE COULD FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">See, Doc. That&#8217;s just what I mean. What the hell kind of talk is that? I don&#8217;t understand it! Get rid of it!”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Sorry, kid, it just slipped out. I&#8217;ll go get ready. Relax. The nurse&#8217;ll be in in a minute. Piece of cake.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Poetry. Ridiculous. It&#8217;s for idiots.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Sure, kid.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">We don&#8217;t need poets.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Of course not. One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is<br />
myself,<br />
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or<br />
ten million years,<br />
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can<br />
wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">My foothold is tenon&#8217;d and mortis&#8217;d in granite,<br />
I laugh at what you call dissolution,<br />
And I know the amplitude of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,<br />
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are<br />
with me,<br />
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I<br />
translate into a new tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br />
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br />
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">&#8230;I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,<br />
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Press close bare-bosom&#8217;d night — press close magnetic<br />
nourishing night!<br />
Night of south winds — night of the large few stars!<br />
Still nodding night — mad naked summer night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Smile O voluptuous cool-breath&#8217;d earth!<br />
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br />
Earth of departed sunset — earth of the mountains misty-topt!<br />
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!<br />
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br />
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!<br />
Far-swooping elbow&#8217;d earth — rich apple-blossom&#8217;d earth!<br />
Smile, for your lover comes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Prodigal, you have given me love — therefore I to you give<br />
love!”</span></p>

<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>The greatest sum is no sum at all. It isn&#8217;t the addition of facts or numbers. It&#8217;s the willingness, for a little while at first, to suspend judgment and consider there are mythic qualities in existence that come from us&#8230;myths greater than machines&#8230;and in order to give voice to the myths we need to go where poets go. We need to go there badly. For our own sake, we have to put that peculiar precision that splits a tiny particle into smaller and smaller pieces on the shelf for a little while&#8230;” (The Magician Awakes) </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Call this an article of faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">These days, people are rightly concerned about spying, snooping, tracking, hacking, profiling. The battle of privacy versus intrusion. The systems that look at other systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And at the same time, the people who are spying and tracking are trying to hide their own secrets. They&#8217;re doing double duty. Just off the top of your head, what would you think of a person who was doing everything he could to assemble the particulars of your life while he was concealing the details of his?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">And suppose his wealth and access were, say, a few hundred billion times greater than yours?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What kind of language is involved in all this computer spying and counter-spying and protection? You don&#8217;t have to be an expert to see it&#8217;s the language of the machine. It&#8217;s certainly elegant in many respects, and it&#8217;s delineated in fine, very fine, and extra-fine shavings of detail. The Trojan Horse is now algorithmic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The people who enter and work in that universe are committed to a meticulous process of move and counter-move. Programs above other programs. Look-ins which are processing the strategies of other look-ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">I&#8217;m interested in all this because the past, present, and future of language is involved. A civilization, to a significant extent, rides on what happens to words&#8212;not as detached entities, but as the expression of what we invent ourselves to be.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>It does not need that a poem should be long. Every word was once a poem.” (Ralph Waldo Emerson)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">These aren&#8217;t minor matters. Imagine what victory in a war means when the survivors, on both sides, emerge with battered minds, bodies, and souls. The experience of war makes them see the future in different terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If freedom is placed in a modern context of privacy vs. no-privacy, the war is going to embroil us in a language of the machine. We&#8217;re going to touch that language, rub up against it in one way or another, use it, oppose some piece of it with another piece of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Children are going to grow up learning it and swimming in it and its effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">In that way, the creeks and streams and rivers and oceans of machine interaction are going to power human thinking.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>&#8230;it is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there&#8230;” (William Carlos Williams) </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s a strange example. People will take a paragraph out of an author&#8217;s novel, extract every key word, and track down their possible references&#8212;and then try to reconstitute the paragraph as if it were lines of secret code. They&#8217;ll rebuild it by welding together those references. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Because mathematics consists of symbol-manipulation, and the symbols have very specific and tight meanings, there is a growing tendency to assume all language works this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But of course, it doesn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Poetry doesn&#8217;t. So the poet, who was already on the far edge of credibility, is reintroduced as a symbol maker, a mathematician slipping a coded revolution into the matrix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">That might make an entertaining science fiction novel, but it has nothing to do with the energy or intent of a poem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Poets may be unearthing hidden treasure, but the spoils of their war are everything mathematics isn&#8217;t. Every great poet destroys the old order. It&#8217;s for the reader to discover and see that, if he can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The old order, which is always and forever fascism dressed up as “greatest good,” keeps resurfacing in the same pool of decay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s the poets who know how to climb down into the muck and also fly above it, waking the dead parts of the psyche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Whoever rules these dead, and how, with what tricks and subterfuge, the royal purpose remains constant: the rejection of poetic consciousness that can fully restore the human being to the life that is his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Poetry does more than reorder reality. It reconstitutes it from the beginning, from the first line on the page of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Society, as it has been shaped, is the sum of illusions that prevent the individual from hearing the first line, even as it echoes in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">This repression is a cooperative exchange in the marketplace. The individual agrees to deafen himself, in order to placate inner forces he fears. Forces that ultimately don&#8217;t exist. The whole operation is a chimera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">It&#8217;s the poets who destroy the old order.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Time let me hail and climb, Golden in the heydays of his eyes. And honoured among wagons, I was prince of the apple towns, And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves Trail with daisies and barley Down the rivers of the windfall light.”</i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table&#8230;”</i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>These are the times that try men&#8217;s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis&#8230;”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">These aren&#8217;t instructions or code or habits to be performed, or political improvements. They&#8217;re grand intrusions on the commonplace labyrinth. They come in at an angle and explode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">As the consciousness of these things dwindles in the era of the machine and all its complications, as the matrix expands to include language-calculations designed to describe what the individual is and isn&#8217;t, a sea of geometry forms the illusion of progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Caught in nests of such symbolic relation, we wait, “till human voices wake us and we drown.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The drowning comes because the voices are speaking and singing in a key that is one small mathematical preoccupation in the infinite spectrum of imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">To the extent the poet is merely taken to be crazy, doom is settling like a shroud around our shoulders.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>&#8230;the willingness to give the response to the heroic&#8230;gets weaker and weaker in every democracy, as time goes on. Then men turn against the heroic appeal, with a sort of venom. They will only listen to the call of mediocrity wielding the insentient bullying power of mediocrity: which is evil.” (DH Lawrence)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But poets always come. They see doom and they use it as fuel for a new fire that ends one epoch and begins another. Who hears them? That is always the open question. We are already living in a new time, if we would recognize it.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>Poetry is the mother tongue of the human race.” (Johann Georg Hamann)</i></span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;"><i>[Poetry:] Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.” (Thomas Gray)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Imagine there were a million new and unknown languages waiting to be discovered. These tongues wouldn&#8217;t make things simpler. They wouldn&#8217;t make machines run more smoothly. They would wake us up to new sensations, feelings, exaltations. They would lead us into worlds that had remained in the shadows because we had no way to express our perception of them. They would light up whole geographies of our consciousness that had been dormant. Every compromise with reality would be exposed as a blatant enormous lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Every “thought-machine” would crumble. The absurdity of building bigger and bigger organizations as the grand solution to conflict would reveal itself so clearly, even android-humans would see it and wake up from their trance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The dim apprehension of what is called “paranormal” would blow up and become part of every-day experience. But most of all, our aesthetic sense would expand in every direction, and we would be able to see how rock-bottom consensus reality is merely a fragment of material for making poetry.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Here&#8217;s an excerpt from my unfinished manuscript, <i>The Magician Awakes</i>:</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You sit there and tell me about your life, but after a while it occurs to me you&#8217;re talking in a blind language. You&#8217;re moving above other words you don&#8217;t give voice to. There&#8217;s another language running in your head, a language you haven&#8217;t found yet. It&#8217;s there, but you don&#8217;t want to look at it. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You vaguely think, from time to time, it might be in Nature. You might find it there. But Nature is just one part of that expression. If the existence of Nature is so clear to you, consider that there are thousands of other Natures. And each one has a language that unlocks it and spreads it out in a different space and time. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Would you rather pull back in and settle on the words you use every day? Would you rather become an expert in those words, a king of those words, a ruler in that small place? Is that the beginning and end of what you want and where you&#8217;re going? Is that all the human race is capable of?</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Because if it is, then we can end this discussion and all discussions. We can please ourselves with what we have. We can dodge and duck. We can inject ourselves with that &#8216;satisfaction drug&#8217; and say there&#8217;s nothing else to do.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">But suppose these thousands of unknown languages, which no people on earth speak, are sitting like gigantic clouds and then moving slowly through our minds. Suppose each one of those languages can wake us up to new KINDS of experience&#8212;experience we perhaps once had but lost. </span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">And then your life, the life you are telling me about, becomes a short story that had force only because it was viewed from a particular slant, your slant, which you found within the one language you speak. Do you see?</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">You&#8217;re battling within that one language and you&#8217;re finding your story in it. You&#8217;ve achieved something. I&#8217;m not asking you to throw it away by the side of the road. I&#8217;m suggesting that this same life can be told from thousands of angles in other languages, and those tongues are much different, much wider, and through them you see a far bigger life&#8230;and you can&#8217;t then avoid it, you can&#8217;t go back, you don&#8217;t want to avoid it&#8230;” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Well, of course, it doesn&#8217;t have to, but that&#8217;s what most people are looking for. An imitation of reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Surrealism, for example, is crazy by conventional standards. Which is its whole point: who set up the conventional standards?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Once you open up that question, all bets are off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">What happens if I write a short play in which Edward Snowden is a dictator in a police state, and the NSA are revolutionaries battling for freedom?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Is that stage play “illegal?” Could reversing roles actually indict the NSA to a greater degree and make its crimes more vivid?</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">No! You&#8217;re twisting everything! Stick to the facts! You&#8217;re soiling the reputation of Edward Snowden!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Is that what I&#8217;m doing? Of course not. But “the reality people” are offended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The notion that inversion or metaphor could be more powerful than fact is impossible for them to conceive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Satire? Never heard of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">The truth is, in every person there is a force of imagination waiting to make a prison break. That force feels great joy in overturning reality. But most people lock it up behind bars. And having locked it up, they don&#8217;t want to be reminded of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Art reminds them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Art is a thorn.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size:large;">Don&#8217;t bother me. I&#8217;m accepting reality. I&#8217;m a loyal foot-soldier in the army of What Is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Such a person is conning himself, but he doesn&#8217;t want to think about it. He doesn&#8217;t want to think about it at all. But a child does. A child is ready to stage little improvisational plays at the drop of a hat. New roles, new stories. For him, reality is soft and elastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">A child is prepared to torpedo any consensus in the service of inventing something spontaneous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Eventually, he learns this a taboo. It isn&#8217;t part of the adult universe. If he&#8217;s going to use his imagination at all, it must be for the purpose of strengthening What Is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">His parents and teachers are there to help him with this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But somewhere down deep, they all know this is collaborating with the enemy. It&#8217;s betraying the core of consciousness. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;">Awareness is only one part of consciousness. The greater part is imagination/creation. It needs no factual foundation. It needs no sanction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Art makes realities, worlds, universes. In doing so, it jettisons rules. It makes up its own rules, or dispenses with rules altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">If more artists understood this, if more people became artists, society would undergo a remarkable transformation. It wouldn&#8217;t turn into a new consensus; it would evolve into millions of side-by-side original creations. What that would look like, how it would operate, is unknown. We&#8217;ve never seen a society like that on planet Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">But there would be no more need for war.</span></p>
