<p>Electricity hasn’t been around all that long. For most of our history mankind has managed very well without it. Large numbers of people around the world still live without an electricity supply. If the grid goes down does it really mean the end of the human race?</p>
<p>A while back  I did a post about pandemics. I said in the introduction, that in my opinion only two things could be serious enough to put an end to humans. Pandemic and grid failure. Looking at the figures for the 1918-1920 pandemic, and using those percentages with current population, it seems I may have been wrong in my assumptions about pandemics.</p>
<p>So, onto grid failure, which to cover all the things that would be affected, and the speed at which they would be affected would need a large book, it is way too big a subject for an article. This article is based the things we have all heard, that 99% of the population of the United States would be dead within a year and that the world population will plummet. Let’s see.</p>
<p>I have chosen 2010 as the year all of the figures relate to, as that is the closest year that has a full set of statistics available. Figures are taken from World Health Organisation records, love them or hate them they are very good pen pushers and compile statistics about anything and everything.</p>
<p>Okay, we all know that if the grid goes down, so does everything else in short order. Food supply chain, large scale agriculture,hospitals, traffic lights, everything that we regard as part of the very fabric of our lives. We have come to rely on electricity to such an extent that should it vanish from our lives it really would mean the end of the world as we know it. The question is though, would it be an extinction level event?</p>
<p>In 2010 there were 133,000,000 births and 57,000,000 deaths from all causes. The WHO records the following for 2010:</p>
<p>34,000,000 known type 1 diabetics world wide.<br />
64,234,000 known COPD (chronic obstructive airways disease sufferers)world wide.<br />
22,800,000 known cancer sufferers world wide.</p>
<p>These conditions are considered to be those that contribute most to the mean global death rates. Now I am not a statistician, and it is impossible to know the life expectancy of the people suffering from these conditions, so, for the purposes of the exercise I am going to assume they all die in the first year.</p>
<p>This would add 120,000,000 deaths to the 57,000,0000 ‘usual’ deaths giving us 177,000,000 deaths for the first year. On top of this there would be a rise in the murder rate, the death rate from heart attacks would soar, mainly due to unfit people having to engage in hard physical labour, and deaths from lack of medication and medical intervention would skyrocket, as would deaths from malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p>This is where things get difficult, There are no statistics regarding lives saved each year by medical intervention, with no intervention, how many more deaths would this amount to? 10% more? 20%, 50%? Let’s say the global death rate doubles to account for this, and the rise in murders, malnutrition and disease, a 100% increase, this is distinctly possible when you consider the circumstances. So the first year the death rate is 177,000,000 plus another 57,000,000 from doubling the base rate in the first year, giving us an estimated death rate in the first year of 234,000,000 people. If all of those deaths occurred in the United States and nowhere else, there would still be 102,000,000 Americans left. Whilst absolutely disastrous this is nowhere near an extinction level event.</p>
<p>12,650%</p>
<p>The mean annual death rate would have to rise 12,650% in the first year to take us even into the realm of possibility of an extinction level event. Even with that incredible rise there would still be 2,250,000 people left on the planet. Providing one or more groups of 5000 existed there is every likelihood that the planet would become re-populated over time. Groups of 5000 are considered by anthropologists to have enough of a genetic mix to grow at a healthy rate.</p>
<p>Obviously birth rates need to be considered. This was left at 133,000,000 for the first year. Most births take place in the developing world, the highest rates of all being found in regions that currently do not have a grid supplied electricity system. The first year would see a reduction in terminations of pregnancy of some 42,000,000 (the Foundation for Bio-ethical reform) which would increase the birth rate, but deaths of newborns would increase dramatically so the WHO figure was used. All of this boils down to the following:</p>
<p>A 12650% rise in the global yearly death rate would still leave a population of some 2,250,000 people populating the planet. Not all of these people are going to be in areas where disease and starvation will wipe them out. Many people in remote areas will be untouched by a total grid down event, it is feasible that some tribal people may not even know what has happened in the first world.</p>
<p>A total grid down event is highly unlikely to put an end to the human race, even though it will most definitely be for us in the first world, the end of the world as we know it. I am surprised by these findings but it shows very clearly, that to live through an event like this, as opposed to just existing after an event like this, we need to look towards simplifying our lives. We need to wean ourselves off of the electricity that we depend on. We need to have the skills that our grandparents and their grandparents had.</p>
<p>Life without electricity will be different, very, very different, but it will not be the lack of electricity that will make life hellish. We know from our forefathers that although more manually taxing and far less convenient that we can survive and we can do it well. What will make life hellish when the grid fails is those who have no clue how to cope, those who will refuse to work at growing vegetables, those who will see their future in terms of what they can steal from those who have had the foresight to prepare.</p>
<p>Unless we can find a way of getting preparedness accepted by the masses, unless we can make them see that being prepared for such an event is the wise thing to do we will be living with far more zombies than we anticipated.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this is not good news. Drastic as it sounds, those of us who are awake, particularly those living in cities, would do far better with less people around. Resources would be more readily available, land for food growing would be more readily available, as would non-perishable goods, from blankets to pots and pans, that could be scavenged from homes that no longer had inhabitants that needed them.</p>
<p>In my opinion a total grid down event is not the end of everything, but it may well be the tipping point that sets off a hell on earth scenario that lasts for decades.</p>
<p>Take care</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Measles</em></p>
<p>A Texas megachurch linked to at least 21 measles cases has been trying to contain the outbreak by hosting vaccination clinics, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The outbreak started when a person who contracted measles overseas visited Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark, located about 20 miles north of Fort Worth, Texas. Officials with area health departments said those affected by the outbreak range in age from 4-months to 44-years-old. All of the school-aged children with measles were homeschooled, and majority of those who were infected had not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>In a recent sermon posted online, senior pastor Terri Pearsons encouraged those who haven&#8217;t been vaccinated to do so, adding that the Old Testament is &#8220;full of precautionary measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would encourage you to do that. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing wrong with doing that. Go do it. Go do it. Go do it. And go in faith,&#8221; said Pearsons, whose father is televangelist Kenneth Copeland. But she added, if &#8220;you&#8217;ve got this covered in your household by faith and it crosses your heart of faith then don&#8217;t go do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing is stay in faith no matter what you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Tarrant County, where the church is located, 11 of the 16 people with measles were not vaccinated while the others may have had at least one measles vaccination. In nearby Denton County, none of their five cases had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Texas Department of State Health Services spokeswoman Christine Mann said so far across the state there have been 27 cases of the measles this year, with five of those cases having no links to current outbreak. She said it is unclear whether a case recently diagnosed in Harris County, where Houston is located, is tied to the outbreak. There were no cases in the state last year and six the year before.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it finds a pocket of people who are unimmunized, and the majority of our cases are unimmunized so far, then if you are around a person with measles, you will get sick,&#8221; said Russell Jones, chief epidemiologist for Tarrant County Public Health.</p>
<p>Measles is spread by coughing, sneezing and close personal contact with infected people; symptoms include a fever, cough, and a rash on the face. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two doses of the combined vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, called the MMR. The first does should be when they are 12 to 15 months old and the second when they are 4 to 6 years old.</p>
<p>Vaccination opt-out rates nationwide have been creeping up since the mid-2000s, spurred in part by the belief the battery of vaccinations routinely given to infants could lead to autism despite scientific evidence to the contrary and the debunking of one of the most publicized studies that first fueled vaccine fears years ago.</p>
<p>Pearsons&#8217; father is a pioneer of the prosperity gospel, which holds that believers are destined to flourish spiritually, physically and financially — and share the wealth with others. He has built a vast ministry with a worldwide reach. Eagle Mountain International Church is located on the grounds as the Kenneth Copeland Ministries.</p>
<p>Robert Hayes, risk manager with Kenneth Copeland Ministries, said they have held several vaccination clinics since the outbreak. He said the church has never advised against adults or children getting immunized for measles or seeking medical care.</p>
<p>A statement from the organization said their position regarding any medical condition is to &#8220;first seek the wisdom of God, His Word, and appropriate medical attention from a professional that you know and trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hayes did not know why some people had not immunized their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some had for whatever reason chosen not to. Some depending on the age of their child were advised by their physician to wait until the child was a certain number of years old. I don&#8217;t get a sense for why after that they did not,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said if people are still choosing to not be immunized and they&#8217;ve been exposed to the measles they are being asked to isolate themselves until it is clear they are not infected.</p>
<p>The incubation period for measles is about two weeks from exposure to fever. People are contagious from four days before getting the rash to four days before breaking out in a measles rash.

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-53770" alt="mynexttrick" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mynexttrick.jpg" width="282" height="179" />I hear a lot of people complaining that the Obama Administration is leading us down a path where one day we will be living in a police state. I ask you this: What do you consider “a police state?” Does it mean residing a place where authorities are standing in your living room, watching everything you do and waiting to place you in shackles if you violate any new “thought police” statutes? Is it like the Old Soviet Union or the current North Korean regime? What?</p>
<p dir="ltr">While you’re thinking about that, let me tell you where you live right now: You live in a country where the Federal government can (notice I didn’t say “does” or “might” or “will”) <em>can</em> listen to every phone call you make, read every email you send or receive and track your movements once you step outside your home. They <em>can</em>access your IRS information on how much you make, where you make it and your perceived intentions regarding tax-relation activity. Soon they will have all your medical records and <em>can</em> see what you’ve been treated for and what type of doctor you’ve been to. And they can do that without your permission…</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not saying they are doing it. I’m merely pointing out that they <em>can</em>. And they now have been dragged kicking and screaming into admitting it in public, with the exception of a few lies in front of Congress by the head of the NSA, James Clapper (currently the Director of National Intelligence). My question to you is simple: What is a police state?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If for whatever reason, the Federal government decides you are someone of interest, they can, without any concern for your Fourth Amendment rights, investigate all forms of your communication, Facebook postings, Google searches, cell phone conversations, whatever. And if they hear the right buzzwords (they decide the buzzwords) they can do the same to your friends, relatives, enemies, acquaintances, Facebook pals, whoever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You know what I hear less and less of lately? That Snowden is a traitor. And for good reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been told over and over again that the NSA doesn’t spy on Americans. Then they were, but they won’t. Then they would but they couldn’t. Then they did but they won’t anymore. Now they just do. This is about political power, not catching terrorists. Grow up. There is no time in this country’s history where the government has been given power and they didn’t abuse it. It’s the nature of power and this is no different. Need more?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A British newspaper, The Telegraph, is reporting that NSA staff has been using their technology designed to catch terrorists to spy on their lovers, past and present. Yes, there’s nothing like keeping a watchful eye and ear on your ex, just in case they’ve decided to set off that nuclear device they’ve been building in the spare bedroom. The folks who swear they won’t abuse their power or use it in any way to further their careers or help a politician or oppress a fellow American in any way, are keeping tabs on what their love interests are up to. Their phone calls, emails, Internet activity, searches and who knows what else. I’m serious – who knows what else? Raise your hand if you think they haven’t been downloading Snowden’s hot girlfriend’s every email, photo, conversation and <em>who knows what else</em>?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I heard Dana Perino – someone I highly respect and admire – say that with all the intelligence they gather, the NSA is of course going to gather some information by mistake along the way. But this is not an innocent slip-up. This is the deliberate abuse of power and denial of civil liberties guaranteed under the Constitution to their victims and all of us. These weasels did not break the rules – they broke <em>the law</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until they are rooted out and held accountable the NSA should not be in charge of anything. The NSA is not about terrorism or spying, it is about gathering information for coercion, oppression and political extortion. Raise your hand if you think every bit of information on President Obama’s enemies and potential adversaries are not being organized for use by the usual suspects – Axelrod, Valerie Jarrett, Plouffe  - all of ‘em. Go look up the Cloward–Piven strategy and get back to me if you don’t believe it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is a police state?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I just hope that Senator Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul haven’t searched anything online that can be used against them in 2016 <strong>because it will be</strong>. I hope none of their relatives, co-workers or friends have done any research or looked at any subject that will allow CNN, the NY Times, MSNBC, CBS, The Washington Post and all the others to scream the headline; “REPUBLICAN NOMINEE’S UNCLE GOOGLE’S TOPLESS ACTRESS !” Don’t worry; I’m getting to Hillary…</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not exaggerating. It’s so easy now – before you had to sneak into or know somebody at the FBI willing to give you 900 confidential files of Republicans, and then explain how they got in your sitting room with your fingerprints on them. Or you had to be married to the President and the whole thing goes away – but still it was a lot tougher then. Now you just Instant Message your buddy at the NSA; they stop listening to their ex-girlfriend talking to that guy she met at the gas station long enough to upload enough info on anybody to find something that can be twisted into a scandal. Or maybe you need to intimidate, say, a Supreme Court Justice into rewriting ObamaCare so it somehow seems Constitutional?…”Just say it’s a tax or something. What can they do – you’re a frickin’ Supreme Court Judge for life, baby!”… Just being hypothetical there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s what we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clapper lied to Congress, nothing happens</li>
<li>The NSA says they have broken privacy “rules” 3,000 times in the past 12 months or so nothing happens</li>
<li>Again, these are not rules; they are laws that were broken</li>
<li>The law states these violations are felonies which call for up to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison for each violation</li>
<li>No one has been charged</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">This is what we know. Imagine what we don’t know?</p>
<p>If this isn’t a police state, what is? Twenty words or less. Thanks.</p>

<p>Italian experts have been puzzled by the overnight appearance of what looks like a volcanic geyser erupting steam and gases 5 meters into the air.</p>
<p>What appears to be a new fumarole appeared near Rome’s International Fiumicino airport Saturday morning. A vent producing small geyser-like fountains of steam, water and mud was suddenly opened in the ground near a road crossing near Fiumicino.</p>
<p>Geologists are currently examining the phenomenon. It is still a bit unclear whether it is not a man-made accident caused by a broken pipe or similar (which might well be the case). As La Repubblica states, first inspections however indicate that it is in fact a new natural vent. Obviously, there are also already some speculations whether it could be related to volcanic activity.</p>
<p>The nearest possibly still active volcanic system in the area is the Monti Albani, an old but possibly not yet extinct volcanic complex located 20 km SE of the capital. Its last known activity there took place about 20,000 years ago. New volcanic activity in the suburban area of Rome itself is certainly not a completely impossible, but quite unlikely scenario. More data will be needed to shed light on this.</p>
<p>“From Mt. Etna in Sicily up to the Alban hills around Rome, there is a good deal of volcanic activity,” Alberto Basilli, a seismologist at the Italian National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology told The Daily Telegraph.

<p dir="ltr">Both the <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/23/us-readies-possible-missile-strike-against-syria-report/" target="_blank">United States</a> and <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/uk-gathers-warplanes-military-hardware-in-cyprus-base-near-syria-report/" target="_blank">United Kingdom have placed military hardware near Syria</a> in anticipation of a possible upcoming strike which is looking increasingly likely after <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/26/us-accuses-syrian-government-of-using-chemical-weapons-and-destroying-evidence/" target="_blank">Secretary of State John Kerry’s statements earlier Monday</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a Western military attack on Syria would only result in more problems in the region and lead to more bloodshed, according to <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/russia-says-western-attack-on-syria-would-be-catastrophic/2013/08/26/4a7ea122-0e5d-11e3-a2b3-5e107edf9897_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lavrov also said that an attack would be the same kind of “catastrophe” as the interventions in Iraq and Libya, while a senior Syrian official said that they will defend itself against any international attack, according to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57600101/fearing-a-u.s-strike-syria-warns-of-global-chaos/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mikdad told the Associated Press that airstrikes or other military action would not only trigger “chaos” and would also threaten peace and security worldwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, officials in Washington are assessing their various options for an attack which would “probably last no more than two days and involve sea-launched cruise missiles — or, possibly, long-range bombers — striking military targets not directly related to Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal,” according to <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kerry-obama-determined-to-hold-syria-accountable-for-using-chemical-weapons/2013/08/26/599450c2-0e70-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The factors reportedly involved in the decision are:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">1.  The findings of a yet-to-be-completed intelligence report evaluating any culpability on the part of the Syrian government in the <a href="http://endthelie.com/2013/08/21/russia-suggests-syria-chemical-attack-carried-out-by-rebels-provocation-not-ruled-out/" target="_blank">alleged chemical attack last week</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  Consultation with allied nations and Congress, both of which are ongoing</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">3.  The determination of a justification for the strike under international law</p>
<p dir="ltr">In his statements, Kerry said that the UN investigation of the chemical attack isn’t informing their current statements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kerry noted that although the UN investigators continue to gather “additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have additional information about this attack, and that information is being compiled and reviewed together with our partners, and we will provide that information in the days ahead,” Kerry said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <em>Post</em> summed up Kerry’s statement as “part of an escalating administration drumbeat, which is likely to include a public statement by Obama in coming days.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">CBS News speaks of the strike in Syria as a certainty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Any final decisions haven’t been made, but senior administration officials talk of Syria now as a place where the U.S. and its allies must exact a military price for heavy use of chemical weapons,” CBS reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) expects that a “response” – which most likely means a military strike – is imminent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think a response is imminent. I talked last evening in the situation room and we’re building support with NATO allies,” Corker said on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/syria-response-bob-corker-95899.html" target="_blank">Monday morning</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Russia is currently one of the greatest obstacles in the way of Western intervention and a significant Syrian ally, Saudi Arabia is attempting to make that change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Russia backs away from Assad, Saudi Arabia reportedly offered a secret deal “to control the global oil market and safeguard Russia’s gas contracts,” according to<em><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/saudis-offer-russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-syria-20130827-2smvt.html" target="_blank"> The Sydney Morning Herald</a></em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leaked transcripts of a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan revealed a quite disturbing conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bandar allegedly promised to protect Russia’s <a href="http://endthelie.com/2011/11/18/russian-warships-entering-syrian-waters-to-inhibit-foreign-invasion-as-opposition-calls-for-no-fly-zone/" target="_blank">naval base in Syria</a> if the Assad government falls and also protect the Sochi Olympics if they agree to a deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the Games are controlled by us,” Prince Bandar allegedly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We use them in the face of the Syrian regime but they will have no role in Syria’s political future,” he reportedly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this is accurate, it is a quite amazing, though not all that surprising, statement. It remains to be seen if Russia will back away from Syria in the coming days. For now, they seem to be standing behind Assad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Putin reportedly told British Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="http://rt.com/news/putin-cameron-syria-attack-020/" target="_blank">earlier Monday</a> that there is no evidence that Assad’s forces were behind the alleged chemical attack.</p>
<p>If Russia suddenly stops opposing Western intervention in Syria, the <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/01/13/foreign-syrian-intervention-and-the-russian-chinese-opposition/" target="_blank">last real obstacle would be removed</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;">Firefighters battling the Rim Fire. (Photo: InciWeb)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The huge fire raging around Yosemite National Park now covers more than 230 sq miles (600 sq km) and continues to grow with just a small percentage of it contained.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It continues moving and is now only 20 miles from the park&#8217;s main tourist area.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Rim Fire is one of 50 fires currently burning, but it is by far the largest. In all, more than 5000 wild fires have been tackled this year.</p>
<p>The blaze began on 17 August in the Stanislaus National Forest, but the cause is still unknown.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This fire has continued to pose every challenge that there can be on a fire,&#8221; said Daniel Berlant of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.(<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/08/26-3">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>2800 firefighters are tackling the blaze which is now threatening the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The reservoir supplies the city of San Francisco with its municipal water. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a State of Emergency for the San Francisco area due to the fire threatening the power lines as well as the water supply.</p>
<p>San Francisco has had to buy power on the open market at a cost of $600,000 because two of the three power stations that supply the city have been closed down as a safeguarding measure.</p>
<p>Ash is said to be falling like snow on the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which supplies San Francisco with 85% of its water. Visibility in the smoke-ridden area is down to 100ft (30m), but officials say the water quality is still good.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The water we are receiving is still of good quality,&#8221; said Harlan Kelly Jr, general manager of the city&#8217;s Public Utilities Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing down as much water as possible and replenishing all of the local reservoirs.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23829047">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ash and smoke are affecting air quality as far away as Reno, Nevada.  <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/067.html#SPE" target="_blank">Air advisories </a>are in effect for most of Northern California and people are encouraged to stay indoors and avoid strenuous outdoor activities.</p>

<p>Our communications systems are still considered among the world’s most extensive and dependable. However, the infrastructure is extremely outdated and unusual conditions can and do put a strain on our grid. With the rise of natural and man-made disasters and an aging infrastructure, experts from the private and public sector warn that we are just <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/when-the-grid-goes-down-you-better-be-ready_10022012/" target="_blank">one major catastrophic event</a> away from the possibility of an event taking down the grid, thus causing a complete meltdown of life in America as we know it today.</p>
<p>Consider, for a moment, how drastically your life would change without the continuous flow of energy the grid delivers. What would our lives be like without access to communication channels telling us what is going on? How vulnerable would we feel not getting our daily dose of local, and world news? For that matter, how would we get in touch with loved ones to let them know how we are?</p>
<p>According to James Rawles, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Survive-End-World-Know/dp/0452295831" target="_blank">How to Survive the End of the World As We Know It</a>, most radio and TV stations have enough fuel to run their backup generators for only a few days. Ditto for the telephone company central offices (COs).  If that is the case, then what will happen when those generators run out of power? As he points out, “there will be an acute information vacuum.”</p>
<p>Communication in a grid down scenario is going to be<em> vital</em> in any serious emergency. Therefore, the best way to to prepare for this situation is to equip yourself with the knowledge and tools for communication. Rawles states, “Once you’ve mastered short-range communications and public service band monitoring, the next step is to join your local Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) affiliate club and study to get your amateur license.” Because many of us are not familiar with the vast array of emergency comm devices, the following list is recommended in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Survive-End-World-Know/dp/0452295831" target="_blank">How to Survive the End of the World As We Know It</a>, (p.193-198) as well as a brief description of how they operate:</p>
<p><strong> Shortwave Receiver</strong></p>
<p>Shortwave radio is a type of long-range radio transmission that bounces signals off a layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere to be received in another part of the world.  The ionosphere, located about 100 miles (160 km) over the earth’s surface, has the unique ability of being able to reflect certain radio frequencies. Unlike AM and FM radio, shortwave radio frequencies can bounce off of the ionosphere and be heard many thousands of miles away. This allows users to be able to hear shortwave radio broadcasters from other countries throughout the world. The ionosphere typically bounces the widest variety of shortwave radio frequencies at night, especially within a few hours of sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p>Rawles suggests that your receiver be a compact, portable general coverage AM/FM/weather band/CB/shortwave receiver. The secret to making a receiver last are to buy a couple of spare hand-reel antennas, show care in putting stress on the headphone jack and power-cable connections, and always carry the radio and accessories in a sturdy, well-padded, preferably waterproof case.</p>
<p><em>The top brands are Grundig, Sangean, Eton, Kaito, Sony</em></p>
<p><strong>Transceivers</strong></p>
<p>A transceiver or transmitter/receiver is a device that combines transmission and reception capability on shared circuitry. In regions where digital coverage is spotty, a transceiver may be equipped for analog to ensure that there will be no loss of signal. Transceivers can handle analog or digital signals, and in some cases, both. Communication and reception are dependent on the range of frequencies. For instance, if you live on a piece of land where there are a lot of hills or trees, your range would be affected. Satellites can also play a part in how well the transceiver works and transmit across greater distances. Keep in mind, the more high powered a transceiver is, the more expensive it is, and also the larger it tends to be.</p>
<p>Ham radio transceivers, for example can broadcast and receive transmissions for over 50 miles, and some can let you talk with people from the other side of the planet. One prepper advised me that for a small broadcasting radius (10 miles or fewer), tune all your radios to the 440 MHz band or anywhere from 144 to 148 MHz (each radio must be on the exact same frequency). Conversations on a ham radio are not secure or private, so don’t broadcast any personal information over the airwaves, just in case.</p>
<p>There are two different types of tranceivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full duplex - In a full duplex transceiver, the device can transmit and receive at the same time. Cell phones are an excellent example of a full duplex transceiver, as both parties can talk at once.</li>
<li>Half duplex – A half duplex transceiver silences one party while the other transmits. Many radio systems operate on a half duplex method, which is why people signal when they are going “out,” alerting the other user to the fact that the frequency is open for transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experts say that the tranceivers that are portable and can attach to gear or uniforms are good, they do, however have a disadvantage of being weak, with a limited range which can become problematic at times. On <a href="http://www.survivalblog.com/2009/05/snippets_from_the_survivalblog.html" target="_blank">Survival Blog</a>, Rawles indicates that he prefers Multi Use Radio Service (MURS) band, since most MURS radios can be programmed to operate in the 2 Meter band, and because they have much better range than FRS (Family Radio Service) radios. But like FRS, they are unregulated in most private use. (No license required!) It is also important to note that the CB channels, FRS channels, and 2 Meter band frequencies will likely be very crowded WTSHTF, particularly in the suburbs, but the less well-known and less populated MURS frequencies will probably be largely available at any given time.</p>
<p><em>The top brands include MURS, Yaesu VX-3R VHF/UHF, Handheld VHF 2 Meter Amateur Radio Tranceiver 5watt, TYT TH-F5 </em></p>
<p><strong>CB Radio</strong></p>
<p>CB radio or Citizens’ band (CB) radio is a communication device that allows people to talk to each other using a radio frequency. The CB radio user has 40 channels to choose from and uses an 11 meter band or 27 MHz. You want to make sure that your CB radio is SSB capable.</p>
<p><em>Top brands include an Cobra 148GTL, Midland 1001Z, Cobra 75 WX ST</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Telephones</strong></p>
<p>Field telephones are mobile telephones designed for military use, and have the capability to withstand wartime conditions. They can draw power from their own battery, from a telephone exchange (via a central battery known as CB), or from an external power source. There are some that are sound-powered telephones, and do not require a battery.</p>
<p>Rawles believes that having reliable field telephones is essential to coordinate retreat security in a post-TEOTWAWKI world. For semi-permanent installation, it is best to buy cable that is rated for underground burial (UB), to conceal and protect all of your lines. Burying your lines will also prevent both intentional and unintentional lines cuts and breaks. He goes on to further suggest buying extra field phones, so that you can run commo wire to your neighbors and coordinate with them as well. To purchase field telephones, look on eBay, at Army surplus stores, or emergency supply stores.</p>
<p><em>Top brands are TA-1042 DNVT, TA 838, TA-312</em></p>
<p><strong>Table Radio</strong></p>
<p>Essentially table radios are contained radio receivers and can mostly be found on eBay. Many can run on battery power, thus making them useful as emergency radios. Because some table radios still use the vacuum-tube technology, they are virtually EMP proof. Rawles suggests finding a radio with shortwave bands, such as a Zenith TransOceanic H500 and to purchase a redundant commo gear (headsets, antennas, etc).</p>
<p><em>Top suggested brands include: Zenith TransOceanic H500, Drake R8B</em></p>
<p>Some other features to consider when purchasing emergency communications equipment is:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have more control when you have knobs on the radios rather than buttons.</li>
<li> Antenna masts that can be telescoped when not in use.</li>
<li>Vertical yagis antennas stick out, but horizontal ones blend in. (They just look like television antennas, to the casual observer.) So consider getting one that pivots for operation in both polarizations. Not only will it give you better OPSEC, but it will give you better versatility.</li>
<li>If a license is required to operate</li>
<li>The power source it uses to operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>During emergencies, our total dependence on communications becomes all to clear. And, if the emergency is severe enough, the communication could be limited, if not non-existent for a given amount of time. Each of us have read enough  survival books to know that the “comm down” scenario is a very real threat, and happens more often than not. So, when we are on our own, will you have your own communication devices set up to communicate with others or will you take a gamble and stay in the dark?

He has shared his knowledge with our community over the last few years, and in the article below he changes our perceptions once again.

<p><em>THIS IS REALITY.</em></p>
<p><strong>Walking the Line Between Human and Animal<br />
</strong><em>by Selco</em></p>
<p>As many long term readers or members of my <a title="Survival course" href="http://shtfschool.com/members/signup/index/c/MwHZCVXv" target="_blank">survival course</a> know, I like to talk about the important but what some may call the “not so spectacular” part of survival that is not as much fun as, for example, talking about latest guns and gadgets.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about dignity and what it means in a survival scenario. Before I talk from own experience, read the extract below from the <a href="http://www.bergenbelsen.co.uk/pages/Database/ReliefStaffAccount.asp?HeroesID=17&amp;=17" target="_blank">diary of Lieutenant Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin</a> who describes what happened after his unit freed the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during the second world war.</p>
<p>At the moment of his writing hundreds of people were still dying and it was place of pure horror.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was shortly after the British Red Cross arrived, though it may have no connection, that a very large quantity of lipstick arrived. This was not at all what we men wanted, we were screaming for hundreds and thousands of other things and I don’t know who asked for lipstick. I wish so much that I could discover who did it, it was the action of genius, sheer unadulterated brilliance. I believe nothing did more for those internees than the lipstick. Women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. I saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. At last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tattooed on the arm. At last they could take an interest in their appearance. That lipstick started to give them back their humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The importance of still being human and not becoming a complete animal is often overlooked for people who prepare for long term survival. I had over one year to fight against becoming like rats around our house during the war.</p>
<p><strong>Expect to become more like an animal</strong></p>
<p>You can have all equipment ready for SHTF – ammo, weapons, gear… you can even be perfectly well trained in lot of different skills and fields and still when SHTF you can end up dead in the first days just because you “refuse to believe” what’s happening.</p>
<p>It is that state of mind when a man simply does not want (or is not able) to comprehend the new situation.</p>
<p>It can be one quick life threatening situation like folks attacking your home and you just waited few seconds too long to shoot some attacker, and then you are dead, end of the story. Or it can be whole process of failing to recognize the new world around you and the new rules (or absence of rules) and then again you just not doing correct things for the situation, and again you end up dead.</p>
<p>Example would be that when SHTF you are trying desperately to have and use power generator and light all rooms in your houses just because it mean normal life for you. And that normal life is gone, and trying to bring it back in that situation usually means more troubles.</p>
<p>Holding on to all the comforts and behavior you are used to can be dangerous.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, what I am trying to say is that you may be trained and equipped like a SEAL team member and yet you can still be killed easily from some 70 years old dude, with even older rifle just because you were surprised when SHTF with amount of destruction and violence and you did not seen that old dude coming (or being so evil).</p>
<p>On the other side that old dude maybe lived through couple of SHTF events in his life, and he knows when it is time to act without hesitation and mercy.</p>
<p>There is still a fine line you have to walk between losing your human side and becoming pure animal.</p>
<p>One of the things that changed a lot when SHTF is fact that everything became really dirty.</p>
<p>It was something like slow process, first people tried to keep it as clean they could, but without all normal services, like garbage trucks, running water and all other community services that make normal living soon it simple became impossible.</p>
<p>Later all garbage was used somehow, but in beginning it started piling up everywhere, when you add to that ruins on the street, human waste and dead bodies it was very ugly picture.</p>
<p>After some time, we started to accept dirt outside and it then was priority to stay clean and keep clean only inside that small circle inside your home, and when I say „clean“ I do not mean „clean“ like today. Maybe as clean as we could be.</p>
<p>For example simply moving through the city in the middle of the night meant that you needed to crawl, jump, hide, walk or run trough all kind of things, and very often some real nasty and dirty things.</p>
<p>Many times I was hiding on places so dirty that stench was almost paralyzing, once in the middle of the night I jumped behind some wall because sudden shelling, and when I jumped there I realized that I landed on dead guy.</p>
<p>His face was smashed with broken wall, and partially buried, place there was so small that I had to actually lay on him for some 20 minutes. He died probably when wall from the house collapsed after some shelling, who knows.</p>
<p>Fire from the shelling was so strong that I actually loved that dead guy and that place in that moment. I almost hug him while I was trying to be as small as possible because pieces of steel and rock were flying around me just like some crazy rain, while my stomach was rising and floating from the detonations and smell.</p>
<p>All I was saying at that moment was „thank you, thank you, thank you“ like some magic words, and I even was not aware who do I thank to, that dead stinky guy, my brain for noticing that small space, or God for saving me.</p>
<p>Today years and years later I still carry that smell inside my nose. But I did not move from there before danger was gone. It is survival and luckily I was already used to dirt enough to just stay with that dead guy.</p>
<p>Some folks just stopped to care about cleanliness and hygiene completely. So for them washing and cleaning become something like not wanted luxury. They went complete animal.</p>
<p>They simply stopped to care about these things, so I also knew some guys with look and smell so awful that even dead guy smelled like perfume store.</p>
<p>It was easy to surrender to stuff like that, I mean in trying to keep yourself clean.</p>
<p>But it was stupid not only in terms of the hygiene and illnesses, also by surrendering yourself you admit that you do not care anymore, and when you admit that you are only few steps from becoming animal with what you do too. People give up on themselves.</p>
<p>For me being as clean as I could be had something like preserving one of the last connection with “normal” life, with life before sh!t hit the fan, when things like neighbors, breakfast, car etc, were just things we took for granted, like things that always gonna be there unchanged.</p>
<p>Of course I was aware that being clean is important in order to stay alive because all diseases problem, no doctors hospitals etc. but on some psychological level it kept me sane and it kept me normal man.</p>
<p>Even in survival situation you need to still care about few little things to keep your dignity, to keep spirit up, to not lose yourself. If you stop caring about everything it is like disease that eats you.</p>
<p>When I came back from trading or scavenging in the city, I would clean or wash myself thoroughly in my yard before entering my house, again of course because common sense, hygiene and diseases, but maybe even more important I tried to keep all chaos and violence, suffering outside of my home on some psychological level.</p>
<p>I try to stay out of the everything, or actually I tried to keep everything outside of my home, like some ritual. I would keep the clothes for outside in bag, my boots were in one corner, never entering my room in it etc.</p>
<p>One of my relative wears pink slippers (mittens) when he was home sometimes, he would say that he just felt that everything is fine when he wear it. It was spooky and strange to see him in pink slippers while outside world is going to hell, but we all have some strange ways I guess to keep ourselves sane. Maybe wearing those slippers after he was forced to shoot some folks kept him sane, reminded him on some normal times when grandma wear it in the evenings.</p>
<p>On the other side, like I said in beginning if you stick too much to old habits you are not doing best for survival too.</p>
<p>So if I had to be animal, I was animal. It was about survival. For example there was a period when I eat just to survive, like animal, without paying attention what I eat or how. If I found some food I ate it in quick way, if there was some food with worms in it, I would eat it in dark, without looking what I eat etc.</p>
<p>Point was (and still is) to be man, but to be ready to be animal if you are forced to be animal, and that’s it. It comes down to being flexible, adapting to situation and I hope this helps to crush the idea some Hollywood or fantasy survival scenarios show that survival is about being complete animal. No, it is fine line to walk.</p>
<p>You can (and you have to) have as much hand sanitizers, soap, disposable face masks etc. as you can but you can still end up dead if you are not ready to accept fact that one day you might be forced to „hug“ dead guy in order to survive, or eat roast rat or pigeon.</p>
<p>Once next collapse comes many people will wake up to reality and struggle to be human like they were or become animals and as skilled survivalist I hope you will walk fine line in between. The people who were walking that path were and I’m sure will be those who have biggest chances to survive.</p>
