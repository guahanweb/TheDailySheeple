<p>By <strong>Cassius Methyl<br /> <a href="http://intellihub.com/2013/07/24/doj-fbi-admit-they-used-hair-analysis-to-convict-thousands-of-people-announce-they-will-re-analyze-past-cases/" target="_blank">Intellihub.com</a></strong><br /> July 24, 2013</p>
<p>The prosecution used hair analysis as if it were a flawlessly accurate test, and their mistakes may have imprisoned and/or killed &#8220;a lot of people.” The DOJ/FBI are allegedly going to review over 2000 old cases soon, in which hair samples and testing were used to convict people, in a rare and seemingly desperate attempt at retaining credibility.</p>
<p>But of course they violate the constitution and are therefore criminals, so of course the credibility of these agencies is an illusion. To sum it up, in order to still appear like they ‘serve justice’, the DOJ and FBI are going to review 2000+ past cases, to see if they accidentally convicted and imprisoned or murdered people deemed innocent by the state.</p>
<p>“This will be critical to giving wrongly convicted people a fair chance at a fair review,” said Steven D. Benjamin, a Virginia attorney who’s the president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</p>
<p>This is another event showing that the massive conscious awakening going on in the US and all over the world right now, is putting pressure on the government and ‘the system’, including these compliant agencies.</p>
<p>This, of course, isn’t the most important instance where a government agency had to compromise with the people they claim to serve, in order to still exist, yet this could be looked at as another way that activism is working.</p>
<p>Activism, and the consciousness brought to us by mass communication, is surely advancing how the citizens can keep the government in check. There is an enormous mental transformation going on.  People who believe the lies of the dysfunctional establishment and government, are radically transforming into people who will defend their life, liberty, and natural rights, people who will not be manipulated or hurt even if the attackers have badges.</p>
<p>In this instance, ‘radical’ is a good thing. The FBI and DOJ will surely be rendered obsolete one day, in exchange for people defending themselves, or communities of voluntarily cooperative people doing what these alphabet soup agencies of the government claim to do. Why? People are becoming too painfully aware that these agencies, and this very ‘system’ of government and federal reserve/debt based economy, is in no way beneficial.</p>
<p>How could imprisoning and possibly killing innocent people possibly be beneficial? The point is, we can have a better society, we can do better. The internet and ideological fuel for this awakening cannot be stopped, and the citizens of the US and world will not let people who commit victimless ‘crimes’ suffer, and this event covered in this article is one sign that the DOJ and FBI are desperate to appear beneficial. They have an interest in appearing that they are on the side of justice because they are in danger of being rendered obsolete, and they are NOT on the side of ‘justice’.</p>

<h3>OpEd</h3>
<p>Being part of the Elite has its rewards, and one of them is the unwritten agreement to keep negative news away from the public – this seems to be one of the most common practices of the ‘Inner Circle’ of Elitists. Is this the practice of <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com" target="_blank"><strong>Bloomberg Businessweek</strong></a>?</p>
<p>The article posted July 24, 2013 on <b><a href="http://intellihub.com/">Intellihub.com</a></b> by <b>Christina Sarich </b><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/pepsicos-naked-juices-drop-all-natural-label-9-million-lawsuit/#ixzz2Zwx7Zriy" target="_blank"><b>Natural Society</b></a> led to the discovery that <b><a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=154155" target="_blank">Bloomberg Businessweek</a></b> failed to report the news on the Naked Juice $9 million dollar settlement, as described in the article <b><a href="http://intellihub.com/2013/07/24/pepsicos-naked-juices-have-to-drop-all-natural-label-after-9-million-class-action-lawsuit/">PepsiCo’s Naked Juices Have to Drop ‘All Natural’ Label after $9 Million Class Action Lawsuit.</a></b></p>
<p>One can see that the Bloomberg Businessweek information is missing (<a href="http://intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/naked-juice.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>image</strong></a>). Is this due to Bloomberg covering for Naked Juice &amp; Pepsico? Time will bear this out as the information was posted on Wikipedia on 22 July 2013 as the following links detail clearly.</p>

<p>Here are excerpts from the actual <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Juice">Wikipedia article on Naked Juice</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In November 2006, PepsiCo announced plans to acquire Naked Juice from its prior owners, North Castle Partners, for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition, which was completed in 2007, was recognized as marking PepsiCo&#8217;s more recent shift towards ownership of food and beverage brands with a health and wellness aspect. At this time, Naked Juice had recorded annual sales of $150 million within the U.S. According to financial industry analysts, this acquisition was initiated in part to compete with <strong><a title="The Coca-Cola Company" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company" target="_blank">The Coca-Cola Company</a></strong>&#8216;s 2001 purchase of Naked Juice rival Odwalla.<sup>[7][8][9]</sup></i></p>
<p><i>Since 2007, the Naked Juice brand has operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, under the parent company&#8217;s <strong><a title="PepsiCo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo#PepsiCo_Americas_Beverages">PepsiCo Americas Beverages</a></strong> division. Naked Juice continued to conduct business in its original Azusa, California headquarters until February, 2010, when its offices were relocated to the neighboring city of Monrovia, California.<sup>[1]</sup> Due in part to PepsiCo&#8217;s scale of existing distributors, Naked Juice has since expanded to be sold in all 50 states within the U.S., as well as in Canada and the U.K.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Juice#cite_note-nakedjuice-10" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup></i></p>
<p><i>On September 28, 2011 a major lawsuit was filed against the company. And in December 2012, the Naked Juice Company settled a class-action lawsuit which argued that many of the bottle&#8217;s purported claims were false and misleading to the public. Specifically, claims that the product was &#8220;100% Juice&#8221;, was &#8220;All Natural&#8221;, contained &#8220;Nothing Artificial&#8221;, and was &#8220;Non-GMO&#8221; were all at issue. Specifically the lawsuit indicated that certain ingredients, listed as vitamins, as displayed in the ingredient list of the nutrition facts, were actually synthetically produced, artificial sweeteners, fibers, and flavors which belied the claim the the product was &#8220;All Natural&#8221; and contained only juice. <b>Also the company knowingly put <a title="Genetically modified organisms" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organisms" target="_blank">Genetically Modified Organisms</a> in the product which contradicts the claim that it was Non-GMO.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Juice#cite_note-11" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<p>In looking for the smoking gun, some interesting connections came to light when looking at the <b><a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=154155">Bloomberg Businessweek Company Overview of Naked Juice</a> </b></p>

<p><i>Naked Juice Co. is Accuses of Deceptive Marketing</i></p>
<p><i>Nov 23 11</i></p>
<p><i>There&#8217;s more to Naked Juice than the Monrovia juice company promotes in its advertising, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Naked Juice and parent company PepsiCo Inc. of marketing juice products as all natural when they actually contain unnaturally processed and synthetic ingredients. Those ingredients include zinc oxide, ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin and others. Consumers were deceived into believing that the unnatural products were in fact natural substances, but were actually created through artificial and mechanical means. The lawsuit, filed by Los Angeles consumer Gina Park, seeks certification as a class action. It accuses Naked Juice of violating California&#8217;s Unfair Business Practices Act and seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order that the company discontinue its marketing practices.</i></p>

<p>A leaked document identified as a report from the Pakistani government indicates that the robotic warplanes have killed more people than the U.S. government has claimed.</p>
<p>The report claims that 746 people, including 94 children, have been killed in drone strikes. The report examined 75 separate drone strikes between 2006 and 2009 that occurred in the Federally Administered ‘Tribal Areas’ of Pakistan, a region along the Pakistani border used by the Taliban as a base area. And as <a href="http://www.storyleak.com/trayvon-riots-us-kid-killed-obama-drone-strike-ignored/">Anthony Gucciardi recently reported</a>, more drone deaths continue to come out with minor recognition from the media.</p>
<h2><strong>Real Casualty Numbers Unknown</strong></h2>
<p>These claims are probably too low because they don’t list all the drone strikes that have been carried out since 2009. Nor do they list drone strikes that might have occurred outside the Tribal Areas. Last year Pakistan’s Interior Minister Rehman Malik told the press that <a href="http://rt.com/usa/cia-drone-agency-civilians-820/">between 2,500 and 3,000 people</a> have been killed by drone strikes. Malik also said that there had been 336 drones in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Both Malik’s claims and the report contradict the CIA’s official story—in 2011 the agency claimed that 50 noncombatants had been killed in all of its drone strikes since Sept. 11, 2001. That claim seems very dubious, particularly since it is not clear that the CIA has been able to examine all of the drone attack sites.</p>
<p>The report itself is questionable because its source is not identified. The organization that uncovered and publicized it, the <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/07/22/exclusive-leaked-pakistani-report-confirms-high-civilian-death-toll-in-cia-drone-strikes/">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, did not identify which Pakistani government agency produced it. Although, the report indicates the Pakistani government has extensive details of the attacks. Instead, it simply says the document came from three sources—what three sources?</p>
<p>During the period detailed in the report, the Pakistani government was supporting the strikes because they got rid of its enemies. The drone attacks are unpopular in Pakistan, but the Pakistani army has tolerated them because they kill some of its enemies.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>The Pakistani document indicated that a large number of Taliban militants and their commanders died in the attacks. That indicates the CIA has extensive knowledge of the militants and their operations, probably from agents inside the organization. It also means that the CIA itself is well aware of the true casualty figures.</p>
<h2><strong>Are Other Nations Carrying Out Drone Attacks in Pakistan?</strong></h2>
<p>There is also an intriguing mystery in the report that the Bureau uncovered. Its reporter, Chris Woods, noted that there were five attacks carried out by forces that the Pakistani government could not or would not identify. That is bothersome because it indicates that other governments, perhaps India’s or China’s, might also be carrying out drone attacks in Pakistan. Both India and China have been attacked by militants backed by the Pakistani Taliban in the past.</p>
<p>By carrying out such attacks, the United States sets a precedent for other nations and implies that such killings are a legitimate method of war. A government that claims that it has the right to carry out these drone attacks gives other governments that right as well.</p>
<p>The whole concept of drone warfare needs to be reviewed due to the true mass number of deaths and other devastating consequences that stem from it. We need to ask ourselves if we want to live in a world where drone attacks are an accepted everyday occurrence.  And what about predator <a href="http://www.storyleak.com/armed-domestic-drone-strikes-reality/">drone attacks inside the US</a>? After all, they seem to violate not only the Constitution but the Ten Commandments and basic Christian morality. Especially when it comes to shedding innocent blood.</p>

<p>While government agencies like the FDA keep stalling on demanding rigorous scientific testing of numerous questionable ingredients, GMO foods, and the correct labeling of such foods, <strong>PepsiCo <a href="http://www.beveragedaily.com/Regulation-Safety/PepsiCo-brand-Naked-Juice-cuts-all-natural-claim-after-9m-US-payout">has recently agreed</a> to settle out of court for $9 million over a class action lawsuit that claimed <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/09/28/40142.htm" target="_blank">‘natural’ and ‘non-GMO’</a> on their bottles was misleading since they are made with GMO ingredients, as well as synthetic and ‘unnatural’ items.</strong></p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the suit claimed that PepsiCo gave the “the false impression that the beverages vitamin content is due to the nutritious fruits and juices, rather than the added synthetic compounds such as calcium pantothenate (synthetically produced from formaldehyde)” and “Fibersol-2 (a proprietary synthetic digestion-resistant fiber produced by Archer Daniels Midland and developed by a Japanese chemical company), fructooligosaccharides (a synthetic fiber and sweetener), and inulin (an artificial and invisible fiber added to foods to … increase fiber content without the typical fiber mouth-feel).”</p>
<p>The amount of synthetic additives in Naked juices are quite possibly more than anything ‘natural’ at all. It certainly isn’t a ‘100% juice” smoothie as the labeling on the bottle currently states. Naked juices contain up to 11 different chemicals including: niacinamide, d-alpha tocopherol acetate, cyanocobalamin, and pyridoxine hydrochloride, just to name a few.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>And as you may have expected, of course Pepsi Co <strong><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/fake-eco-friendly-corporations-millions-gmo-labeling/" target="_blank">donated more than $2.5 million</a></strong> dollars to help defeat Proposition 37 in California that would have required companies like Pepsi to label all products that contain GMOs in any form. The ‘Right to Know” ballot was defeated due to special interest groups like Syngenta, Dow, Monsanto, Pepsi Co, and others who helped finance its demise.</p>
<p>If you would like to avoid PepsiCo altogether since they are actively trying to push <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_27259.cfm" target="_blank">GMO foods</a> and chemical laden drinks on the public while trying to pass them off as ‘health’ food, you might have a hard time ignoring the company – they are in over 200 countries and make everything from Pepsi Cola to Frito Lay Chips, Tropicana Juices, Quaker Oates and Gatorade. But <a href="http://www.pepsico.com/Brands.html" target="_blank">learn of what they create</a>, and you can steer clear.</p>
<p>You can also email PepsiCo’s Senior Director with your opinion about their GMO and unnatural products.

<p>“Something like steam” continued to billow out of Fukushima&#8217;s nuclear reactor 3 building on Tuesday morning, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said, confirming the latest omen that the ongoing nuclear catastrophe will not end any time soon.</p>
<p>The presence of the emissions in the reactor building is the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/world/asia/steam-detected-at-damaged-fukushima-reactor.html?_r=0">second instance</a> in less than a week.</p>
<p>In a worse case scenario, the steam-like substance <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/world/asia/steam-detected-at-damaged-fukushima-reactor.html?_r=0">could be the result of renewed nuclear reactions</a>—a possibility TEPCO, the site&#8217;s operator, denied but one that could mean large amounts of radioactive substances are being released.</p>
<p>TEPCO <a href="http://enenews.com/just-in-fukushima-reactor-site-engulfed-by-steam-something-like-steam-coming-out-of-unit-no-3-continuously-wafting-through-the-air-work-to-remove-rubble-suspended">said</a> workers are continuing to inject cooling water into the reactor and a pool storing nuclear fuel.</p>
<p><em>Japan Times</em> <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/23/national/tepco-sees-steam-again-at-reactor-3/#.Ue6m60omxJM">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co. confirmed Tuesday that “something like steam” again issued from the building housing reactor 3, one of three units to suffer core meltdowns in March 2011, at its crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant.</p>
<p>TEPCO said one of its monitoring cameras showed what appeared to be steam escaping from the building’s fifth floor just above the reactor container at around 9:05 a.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>The steam continued to be seen until 10:30 a.m., TEPCO officials said.</p>
<p>On July 18, what appeared to be steam also was seen at the fifth-floor level of the reactor 3 building. But no steam was seen the following day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Monday TEPCO <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/07/22-9">publicly admitted</a> for the first time since the disaster that contaminated groundwater has been leaking from the nuclear power plant and that the number of workers exposed to dangerous radiation is ten times greater than previously claimed.</p>

<p>Central planning in this country is getting completely and totally out of control.  These days, you can hardly do anything without running into a suffocating web of red tape.  For example, a small-time magician from Missouri that does magic shows for kids was <a title="absolutely horrified" href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/18/marty-the-magician-rabbit-disaster-plan/" target="_blank">absolutely horrified</a> when he learned that the Obama administration is requiring him to submit a 32 page “disaster plan” for the rabbit that he uses in his shows.  Yes, this is actually true. </p>
<p>His name is Marty Hahne, and he thought that it was bad enough when the U.S. Department of Agriculture busted him for not having a “license” for his rabbit.  He went out and acquired the proper “license” for his rabbit, but he never dreamed that eventually he would also have to submit a 32 page “disaster plan” for the same rabbit.</p>
<p>This is a guy that does not make a lot of money.  He mostly does shows for kids <a title="at schools and at libraries" href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/18/marty-the-magician-rabbit-disaster-plan/" target="_blank">at schools and at libraries</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marty Hahne, or <a title="http://www.martythemagician.com/" href="http://www.martythemagician.com/" target="_blank">Marty the Magician</a> as he is known to school groups around Springfield, Mo., where he makes a living making his rabbit, Casey, magically appear in a variety of places (birthday gift, miniature library, cookie jar), is headlining a ventriloquists’ convention in Cincinnati this week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would think that the federal government would have much better things to do than to shake down a small-time magician with one rabbit.  Unfortunately, the control freaks that run things are not about to let anyone off the hook…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires the rabbit to be licensed, which is weird enough, but where things enter the rabbit warren of the truly bizarre is a new USDA rule seven years in the making.</p>
<p>Marty must have a rabbit disaster “plan” in place by July 29, 2013, in case of calamity — “flooding,” “earthquake,” “landslide/mudslide/avalanche,” “wildfire,” “intentional attack,” to name a few examples.</p>
<p>“My country is broke,” Mr. Hahne says. “We are out of money, and now the government is spending time, and money, worrying about an emergency plan for a bunny rabbit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, a woman named Kim Morgan that specializes in writing emergency plans for federal agencies heard about what Mr. Hahne was going through and offered to draft the 32 page disaster plan for free.</p>
<p>But of course this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon.  We are a country that literally has millions of laws, rules and regulations and that is drowning underneath an ocean of red tape.</p>
<p>And it gets worse with each passing year.  For example, just check out what <a title="one recent CNN article" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/23/technology/security/obamacare-privacy/index.html?iid=HP_River" target="_blank">one recent CNN article</a> had to say about the “privacy nightmare” that the new federal Obamacare database is going to create…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When shoppers apply for health insurance through the forthcoming state-based Obamacare exchanges, the online system will verify each applicant’s information by pulling in data from more than half a dozen federal agencies ranging from the IRS to the Peace Corps. It will know who you are, how much money you make, and whether or not you’re in the United States legally.</p>
<p>The prospect of one online system having access to so much personal information is making some watchdogs nervous. In a USA Today op-ed decrying the system as a “privacy nightmare,” researchers Stephen Parente and Paul Howard penned these scary words: “This hub will achieve what has, until now, only appeared in pulp thrillers: a central database linking critical state and federal data on every U.S. citizen for real-time access.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much of a bureaucratic nightmare that is going to be?  Government bureaucrats are going to have access to all of our health information, and they will instantly know where we have failed to comply with the countless new rules and regulations that are being implemented as a part of Obamacare.</p>
<p>It is going to be an absolutely gigantic ball of red tape.  It will be a bureaucratic paradise.</p>
<p>So what can we do about all of this?</p>
<p>Individually, not a whole lot.  But there are some states that are starting to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>For example, the following are some excerpts from a recent email that someone sent to me about what is going on in Oklahoma…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oklahoma law passed, 37 to 9 an amendment to place the Ten Commandments on the front entrance to the state capitol. The feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey this is a conservative state, based on Christian values…! HB 1330</p>
<p>Guess what………. Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>Oklahoma recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. HB 1804. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU, they said it would be a mistake.</p>
<p>Guess what………. Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I’m sure that was a setback for the criminals. The Liberals didn’t like it — But….</p>
<p>Guess what………… Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>Just this month, the state has voted and passed a law that ALL drivers’ license exams will be printed in English, and only English, and no other language. They have been called racist for doing this, but the fact is that ALL of the road signs are in English only. If you want to drive in Oklahoma, you must read and write English. Really simple.</p>
<p>By the way, the Liberals don’t like any of this either.</p>
<p>Guess what…who cares… Oklahoma is doing it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States is not supposed to be a centrally-planned society where control freak bureaucrats watch, track, monitor and control virtually everything that we do.</p>
<p>We are supposed to be a society that maximizes privacy, freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>Sadly, at this point we are becoming more like centrally-planned societies such as China every single day.  And if you want an idea of what life in a society that has a very high degree of central planning is like, just check out <a title="this video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG-meaGqg-M" target="_blank">this video</a> of a subway station during morning rush hour in Beijing…</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xG-meaGqg-M?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A photo of the overcrowding in the subway station in the video above was recently <a title="posted on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/JoeXu/status/358159158786269184/photo/1" target="_blank">posted on Twitter</a>…</p>
<p><a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/obama-administration-requires-magician-to-submit-a-32-page-disaster-plan-for-his-rabbit/subway-station-in-beijing" rel="attachment wp-att-3605"><img alt="Subway Station In Beijing" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Subway-Station-In-Beijing-460x342.jpg" width="460" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>Is that how we want to live?</p>
<p>To the central planners, we are all essentially nameless, faceless cattle that need to be herded in the right direction.</p>
<p>And the central planners always believe that they know better than us.  They believe that we cannot be trusted with freedom and liberty because we cannot handle it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, central planners usually end up making a giant mess of things. And right now they are making a huge mess of the United States. If we don’t stop them, they will continue to wreck our once great nation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/obama-supporters-petition-to-grant-him-immunity-for-all-crimes-he-commits-while-in-office/" target="_blank"><strong>Infowars</strong></a><br />July 24, 2013</p>
<p>Considering the innumerable scandals overshadowing President Obama’s two terms, one would think Americans would be all too eager to cast the arrogant ruler by the wayside.</p>
<p>Rather, as author and political activist Mark Dice illustrates, Americans seem to be reaching new sycophantic heights in demonstrating their enamored, undeterred faith in the murderous tyrant’s dictatorial reign.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OHk3c2L6Rck?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="620" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Dice once again takes to California’s sunny beaches and effortlessly proceeds to gather a multitude of signatures for a fictitious petition seeking to grant the president immunity for crimes he commits while in office.</p>
<p>“We just need to get behind the president and show that we will grant him immunity for any crimes that he may have committed,” Dice tells one distracted beach cyclist.</p>
<p>Dice then thanks the cyclist for her signature, to which she supplies an enthusiastic, “No problem.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure that he’s had a good reason for doing those things… Just, you know, we need to get behind the president no matter what he does, right?” Dice inquires of another person.</p>
<p>“Yes,” another distracted beach-goer blithely replies.</p>
<p>Dice also played up the race card, saying, “I mean, Obama deserves immunity and anybody that tries to charge him with a crime is obviously a racist of some kind.”</p>
<p>“Right,” another signer wholeheartedly agrees.</p>
<p>“Basically… we’re just gonna make sure that Obama can get away with whatever he wants to, just like you can get away with having that doobie right now,” he jokes to a beach-faring, pot-smoker signing the petition.</p>
<p>The sheer ease by which Dice is able to garner signatories simply by mentioning the name Obama is astounding, but his petition signers’ lack of perspicacity is in no way a fluke or accident.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.infowars.com/video-students-submit-to-obama-security-force-bag-searches/" target="_blank">Dice demonstrated last May at San Diego State University</a>, Americans are extremely willing to sacrifice privacy and their Fourth Amendment rights for security.</p>
<p>Following the Boston Marathon bombings, Dice was able to find students willing to submit to random bag searches so long as he prefaced them by saying he was conducting the searches as part of Obama’s citizen security volunteer force.</p>

Deputies assumed she was a drunk driver and broke through her window, ripped her limp body from the vehicle, handcuffed her facedown on the hot pavement, where they left her, motionless.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I was just lost, I was just lost,&#8221; Garcia said. She said her blood sugar was so low that she could have gone into a coma.</p>
<p>Even if Garcia was drunk or on some kind of drugs she did not deserve this kind of treatment and was not being violent with anyone or showing any signs of being a threat.</p>
<p>Garcia showed no resistance and there was obviously no reason to attack her and leave her on the hot pavement where her blood sugar reached a critical level.  These kinds of situations occur everyday, and unfortunately it is rare for someone to even get their side of the story and have anyone believe it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case there was no resistance. We are looking at that very seriously,&#8221; Santa Fe County Sheriff Robert Garcia said. </p>
<p>&#8220;What concerns me is there is no need to lay someone on the ground for that amount of time. There were other deputies around that could have assisted in at least sitting her up or having her placed in a cruiser,&#8221; said the sheriff. </p>
<p>However, it is likely that the people responsible for this attack will not see any punishment for their actions, aside from the possibility of a paid vacation.</p>

<p>The claim came in response from a Freedom of Information Act request sent by Justin Elliot, a reporter at Pro Publica seeking to identify to relationship between the NSA and the National Geographic Channel, which has aired what Pro Publica characterized as sympathetic documentaries on the secretive intelligence entity. </p>
<p>“<i>There’s no central method to search an email at this time with the way our records are set up, unfortunately</i>,” NSA Freedom of Information Act officer Cindy Blacker told Elliot, adding that the current system is “<i>a little antiquated and archaic</i>.” </p>
<p>In a trailer for the National Geographic Channel documentary entitled Inside the NSA: America’s Cyber Secrets, an NSA official described the agency as “<i>energy central</i>” and “<i>the emergency room</i>” to gain intelligence for American decision makers. </p>
<p>“<i>Back in the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s we had an adversary: it was the Soviet Union</i>,” Dickie George, a former NSA technical director, says in the documentary. “<i>They were very much like us: same intent, same motivation, same kind of capabilities and resources. There was a line in the sand, you didn’t go beyond that line. Today’s world is completely different</i>.” </p>
<p>Elliot wrote that the NSA’s FOIA officer contacted him again days after the request to ask that he narrow it to a “person by person” approach for the Agency’s 30,000 employees rather than a broader request for National Geographic-related correspondence. </p>
<p>“<i>It’s just baffling</i>,&#8221; said Mark Caramanica of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press. “<i>This is an agency that’s charged with monitoring millions of communications globally and they can’t even track their own internal communications in response to a FOIA request</i>.” </p>
<p>Pro Publica’s case is hardly unique. Since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the true, shocking and indiscriminate scope of government surveillance, the agency has been inundated with requests from citizens demanding to know what, if any, of their own information has been collected. </p>
<p>Clayton Seymour, a 26-year-old IT specialist who lives in Ohio, told the Tikkun Daily, a progressive blog, that he submitted a FOIA request but was quickly denied under an exception to NSA’s FOIA policy, authorized by US President Barack Obama in 2009. </p>
<p>“<i>Thus, your request is denied pursuant to the first exemption of the FOIA, which provides that the FOIA does not apply to matters that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign relations and are properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order</i>,” stated the denial. </p>
<p>The order in question allows the NSA to refuse to disclose information if is collected covertly, a rule still in effect – and presumably relied upon &#8211; after the Snowden leak.</p>
<p>“<i>I am a generally law abiding citizen with nothing I can think of that would require monitoring, but I wanted to know if I was having data collected about me and if so, what</i>,” Seymour told Tikkun Daily. “<i>When I got the declined letter, I was furious. I feel betrayed</i>.”</p>

<p>Could the actions of the governments get any more brutal, sick, or inhumane? Of course they can always find a way to be more sick.</p>
<p>Now according to reports, the Israeli military <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/21/israel-admits-harvesting_n_399623.html" target="_blank">admits they harvested organs from dead Palestinians and Israeli people in the early 1990&#8242;s</a>, possibly killing Palestinians just for organs, though they did not admit that part.</p>
<p>They would remove corneas from the eye sockets of dead people, and &#8220;glue the eyelids shut&#8221; to mask any organ harvesting.</p>
<p>For years, the Israeli government boldly denied any of this happened, and if a person were to suggest it did, I&#8217;m sure an average citizen here in America would be called the slur &#8220;conspiracy theorist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once again, a so called &#8220;theory&#8221; is proven to be fact. Apparently the gross and disrespectful organ harvesting ended in 2000, but considering the history of this government lying, who knows what still goes on?</p>
