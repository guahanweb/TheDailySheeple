<p>When you&#8217;re sick, little is more comforting than holding a steaming mug of fragrant tea in both hands, warming your face with the hot steam.  Somehow, no matter how rotten you felt before, you instantly feel just a tiny bit better.</p>
<p>Whether you are lucky enough to grow your own tea herbs, you purchase loose teas, or you use tea bags, your cabinet is not complete without the following ingredients.  These teas are delicious and beneficial, with many different healing qualities.  Considering that we most often turn to herbal teas for healing purposes, it&#8217;s especially important to purchase or grow organic herbs for this purpose.  If your leaves are bathed in pesticide and then you add them to boiling water, instead of healing goodness, you are steeping toxins.</p>
<p>When making tea for medicinal purposes, be sure to steep the tea in a teapot with a lid, or to cover your mug while the herbs are steeping.  This helps to make a more potent brew by keeping all of the healing oils in the tea, instead of allowing them to drift into the room.  Most herbs should be steeped for about 10 minutes for maximum results.</p>
<p>There are many different herbs from around the world that have wonderful healing properties. I&#8217;ve concentrated this list on ones that can either be easily acquired and stored, or ones that can be easily grown in a backyard garden or a sunny window. Just like band-aids, antibiotic cream, or aspirin, these items are vital additions to your pantry, allowing you to dispense a hot, steaming, fragrant cup of nurturing in as little time as it takes you to boil water. Be prepared by keeping the following ingredients close at hand, and be self-sufficient by producing for yourself as many as possible (always the best way to make sure that the items were grown using safe, organic methods).</p>
<p>In no particular order&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">1. Mint</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mint.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1912" alt="mint" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mint-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></a></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mint tea is the classic herbal tea. Mint is an ingredient in many different commercial tea blends and is much-loved for its refreshing fragrance.</p>
<p><strong>Growing it:</strong></p>
<p>Mint is an herb that doesn&#8217;t just grow easily &#8211; it can quickly overtake your garden!  For this reason, it is recommended to grow mint in either a container or its own bed. There are many varieties of mint and the healing properties are similar.  Whether you grow peppermint or spearmint, the active component is menthol.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<p>If you suffer from acid reflux, mint tea may worsen your symptoms.  Mint has antispasmodic properties</p>
<p><strong>Mint tea can be used to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce congestion in a cold or flu sufferer</li>
<li>Reduce pain and bloating from gas</li>
<li>Reduce cramping from diarrhea</li>
<li>Act as a mild expectorant for a chest cold or bronchitis</li>

<li>Relieve nausea without vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">2. Ginger</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginger.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1911" alt="ginger" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginger-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>This homely root is an ingredient in many natural cough, cold, and nausea treatments.  Instead of giving your child gingerale when they are suffering from an upset stomach (and all of the HFCS and artificial flavors that come in it) brew up a nice cup of ginger tea sweetened with honey for a real dose of soothing ginger!</p>
<p><strong>Growing it:</strong></p>
<p>Ginger is a tropical plant that is apparently not difficult to grow indoors. It requires excellent soil, warmth, humidity, and filtered sunlight.</p>
<p>You can learn how to grow ginger <a href="http://www.tropicalpermaculture.com/growing-ginger.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>:</p>
<p>It’s not recommended to exceed 4 grams of ginger per day – components in the herb can cause irritation of the mouth, heartburn and diarrhea if taken in excess.</p>

<p>Chamomile tea should be steeped a little longer than other herbal teas in order to get all of the medicinal benefits.  This soothing, slightly apple-flavored tea has mild sedative properties. The petals of the tiny flowers are where the medicinal values lie.</p>
<p><strong>Growing it:</strong></p>
<p>Chamomile is easy to grow from seeds. Start them in the late winter and transfer outdoors when the risk of frost has passed.  Once the plants are well established, chamomile can thrive with little water during hot weather.  When buying your seeds, note that German chamomile is an annual and Roman chamomile is a perennial.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<p>Chamomile tea should be avoided by people who take blood thinners.  As well, those who suffer from ragweed allergies may also have an allergic reaction to chamomile, as the two plants are related.</p>

<p><strong>Growing it:</strong></p>

<p>If you like spicy food, then you are probably a fan of the jalapeno pepper. They are moderately spicy, with a Scoville heat rating of  2,500–10,000. Right now, the garden is just beginning to bring forth these shiny, dark green peppers. If you don&#8217;t have a garden, you can find heaping baskets full of them at your local farmer&#8217;s market. (Find a local farmer&#8217;s market <a href="http://eatlocalgrown.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>).  As jalapenos sit on the vine, they ripen to a deep red.  They are milder when green and intensify in heat as they turn a darker red.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jalapeno trivia:</strong></em> The jalapeno pepper is named for the Mexican town in which it was traditionally grown, Xalapa, Veracruz. A member of the chile pepper family, the jalapeno was used by the Aztecs, who smoked the jalapenos in order to preserve them.</p>
<h2>Nutritional benefits</h2>
<p>Jalapenos have a host of health benefits at a very low caloric cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">One jalapeno pepper contains a negligible 4 calories and less than one gram of carbs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Jalapeno peppers are very high in Vitamins A and C &#8211; just one little pepper contains 20% of the RDA of both vitamins!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Capsaicin, the substance that gives the peppers their heat, has the following properties: anti-inflammatory, vasodilator (improves blood flow and circulation), and metabolic booster.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Capsaicin also shows promise in cancer treatment. One study showed that the substance &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">turns off &#8220;NF-kB, a protein that promotes tumor growth.</span></li>
<li>Because of their inflammation reducing properties, jalapenos are an excellent addition to the diet of anyone who suffers from gout or arthritis.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hot-peppers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1895" alt="hot peppers" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hot-peppers-300x225.jpg" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<h2>Growing Jalapeno Peppers</h2>
<p>Jalapeno plants can be easily grown from seeds. Start the seeds indoors and transplant when the seedling have 4 leaves and when all threat of frost has passed.  Use an organic compost to create a rich soil and plant them in full sun.</p>
<h2>Using Fresh Jalapenos</h2>
<p>WARNING: Hot peppers are the evil vindictive uncles of the vegetable garden family.  Handle them with care because when you cut them up, they fight back.  Use rubber gloves and do not rub your eyes, nose, mouth or any other mucous membrane (that I don’t want to hear about) after handling them.</p>
<p>Most of the heat is in the seeds.  Use or do not use the seeds accordingly to turn up (or down) the heat in your finished product.</p>
<p>If you do happen to get the juice or seeds on your skin (owie!) and you’re still having issues after washing the area, sometimes a milk compress can provide some relief – generally, though, you just have to wait it out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Holy Jalapeno Relish</em></h3>
<p>My absolute favorite use of jalapeno peppers is this relish. Because I like spicy foods a lot more than the rest of the members of my household, this condiment is a great spice-your-own topping for chili or Mexican food, or for stirring into a mild, family-friendly salsa.</p>
<p>The following photos show how to make half a pint of jalapeno relish. The canning version of this recipe can be found below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1.  Wash your freshly picked jalapenos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/j.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1897" alt="j" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/j-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2.  Cut off the stems, then cut the peppers in half.<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jalapeno-relish.jpg"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">3.  (Optional) Wash a handful of cilantro leaves (amount to taste) and add</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">them to the <span style="font-size: 13px;">bowl of the food processor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jp-step-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1899" alt="jp step 3" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jp-step-3-285x300.jpg" width="285" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4.  Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 2-3 teaspoons of</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/sweet-life-how-to-source-non-gmo-sugar-for-your-pantry-11282012" target="_blank">sugar</a> to the bowl of the food processor</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Step 5: Using the pulse function, puree the mixture until it reaches a chunky</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">consistency similar to that of hamburger relish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jp-step-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1901" alt="jp step 5" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jp-step-5-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Using a funnel, put your beautiful, bright green jalapeno</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">relish into a jar.  This will stay good in your refrigerator for 2-4 weeks</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(if it lasts that long &#8211; you may find that you make foods specifically</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">in order to top them with yummy jalapeno relish. )</p>

<h2>Preserving Jalapenos</h2>
<h3>Freezing</h3>
<p>When freezing jalapeno peppers, use your food processor to puree them.  Freeze the puree in ice cube trays until they are solid, then transfer the cubes into a large ziploc bag.</p>
<h3>Drying</h3>
<p>Drying jalapeno peppers is not recommended. They have a thicker flesh than other types of chile peppers and will often rot before they dry.  If you wish to use your dehydrator to dry the peppers, use a piece of waxed paper on the trays to catch the seeds.  Slice them into very thin rings. Alternatively, puree them and leave them overnight in a mesh colander over a bowl in the refrigerator, then spread this thinly over the waxed paper.</p>
<h3>Canning</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Holy Jalapeno Relish</em></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>canning version</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>5 pounds of jalapeno peppers</li>
<li>2 cups of <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/sweet-life-how-to-source-non-gmo-sugar-for-your-pantry-11282012" target="_blank">sugar</a> (white sugar or turbinado)</li>
<li>4 cups of white vinegar</li>
<li>½ cup of cilantro leaves (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Another option, if you want a condiment with less heat, is to replace up to half of the jalapenos with green bell peppers.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Directions:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>In a food processor, finely chop the peppers.  Don’t turn them into a pureed mush – make them the consistency of relish.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a large cooking pot, stir the sugar into the vinegar and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Immediately reduce the heat and stir in your hot peppers.</li>
<li>Use your food processor to chop the cilantro leaves, if you are using them, then stir them into your relish. (Be sure to use the leaves only &#8211; the stems are bitter and unpleasant.)</li>
<li>Bring the relish back to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes until heated through.</li>
<li>Ladle the relish into <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012" target="_blank">sanitized pint jars</a> allowing ½ inch of head space.</li>
<li>Process the jars in a <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-water-bath-canning-12152012" target="_blank">water bath canner</a> for 10 minutes.  Be sure to adjust for <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-altitude-adjustment-12152012" target="_blank">altitude</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Pickled Jalapenos</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">These aren&#8217;t even vaguely similar to the dull, washed out looking grocery store versions!</p>
<ul>
<li>5 pounds of jalapeno peppers</li>
<li>4 tbsp of coarse non-iodized salt</li>
<li>4 cups of white vinegar</li>
<li>1 cup of distilled water</li>
<li>(optional) thinly sliced onion or crushed garlic</li>
</ul>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Taking care to protect your skin with gloves, thinly slice your washed jalapenos into rings.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Meanwhile, in a stockpot, bring the vinegar, water, and salt to a boil.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">If using, divide your onion and/or garlic across your warm, </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012" target="_blank">sanitized pint jars</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> .</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Fill the (still warm) jars with jalapeno slices, packing them tightly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Pour the boiling liquid over the jalapenos, allowing 1 inch of headspace.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Process the jars in a </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-water-bath-canning-12152012" target="_blank">water bath canner</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> for 10 minutes.  Be sure to adjust for </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-altitude-adjustment-12152012" target="_blank">altitude</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></li>

<p>A devastating condition called <a href="http://www.chemicalsensitivityfoundation.org/pdf/What-Is-MCS-by-Ann-McCampbell.pdf" target="_blank">Multiple Chemical Sensitivity</a> is unrecognized by the American Medical Association.  Victims suffer from an array of symptoms including  nausea, fatigue, dizziness, headaches, mental disorientation, inflammation, skin rashes, joint joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and respiratory problems. Conditions such as &#8220;chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, atypical connective tissue disease after silicone breast implants, chronic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), drug-induced autoantibodies/hepatitis (liver toxicity), illness while living near a toxic waste dump site, dental amalgam disease, &#8230; MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether, a gasoline additive)-associated symptoms, [and] inflammation of the lungs caused by diesel exhaust particles&#8221; are related to, or overlap with MCS. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070516181511/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/external/faq/mcss.htm" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>MCS is the result of such a vast chemical overload that a person&#8217;s bodily functions begin to shut down.  Because it is not recognized by the medical profession, research is limited.  Since the answer is the avoidance of chemicals instead of the introduction of more chemicals (pills) Big Pharma has a vested interest in keeping this a non-diagnosis.</p>
<p>Toxins that we in the &#8220;civilized world&#8221; are exposed to on a daily basis can cause flare-ups that lead to hospitalization, disability, and death.  Many who suffer from this condition become self-isolated in an effort to avoid exposure to substances like smoke, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabric, scented items, chemical additives in food, preservatives,  products made from petroleum, and noxious fumes from paint or cleaning products.  Check out the following video to learn more about MCS, an shocking issue that has only arisen in the past few decades as our environment become more and more toxic.</p>

<p>A dubious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a> lists the following as alternative names for MCS:  toxic injury (TI), chemical sensitivity (CS), chemical injury syndrome (CI), 20th century syndrome, environmental illness (EI), sick building syndrome, idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI), and toxicant-induced loss of tolerance (TILT). Gulf War Syndrome and Food Intolerance Syndrome are also considered by some to be a form of MCS.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Mercola, many of the chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis never leave our bodies, but accumulate in fat and bone marrow. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The sheer number of toxic chemicals that you are exposed to on a daily basis is truly staggering. With some 100,000 different chemicals being used throughout the world, and 1,500 or so more being added each year – all without any major oversight or testing for safety until after the fact – is it any wonder that you’re not <a href="http://products.mercola.com/take-control/">as healthy as you should be?</a></p>
<p>The number of toxic chemicals is so large, addressing them all would be an impossible mission, but I believe being an informed and vigilant consumer CAN help you keep your toxic load as low as possible, even if it may be impossible to cut your exposure to zero.</p>
<p>After all, they’re everywhere; in your air, water, soil, food supply, and in a vast majority of the personal care, household and yard products you use on a regular basis. Today, they’re even in the circuitry boards of the electronics you surround yourself with. Some of the sources of toxins you have control over. Others, you don’t. (Click <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/07/10/no-one-is-safe-from-chemical-overload.aspx" target="_blank">HERE</a> to read Dr. Mercola&#8217;s tips on avoiding chemical overload)</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently I wrote an article called <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-great-american-genocide-07032013" target="_blank">The Great American Genocide</a>, in which I discussed how the toxins we are exposed to on a daily basis are making us sick, setting up our children for infertility, and inevitably bringing us to an early death.  I received an email  from a victim of these toxins who has lost everything. I am republishing here (with permission) because it&#8217;s time that we, as a society, stop putting our fingers in our ears and singing &#8220;Lalalalala&#8221; in an effort to drown out the stories from victims like this.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My name is Kim and I have had direct horrible life trauma due to environment and chemical poisoning because of what is being done in this country. </em></p>
<p><em>About 11 years ago I was eating a burger from McDonald and cracked a back molar on a piece of bone in the burger, that tooth had previously been &#8220;fixed&#8221; with an amalgam (mercury) filling. Well after it broke it didn&#8217;t really hurt and I didn&#8217;t have insurance so I never got it fixed. About a year later I starting having what I was told was panic attacks and anxiety issues (I much later found out that was not the issue). </em></p>
<p><em>After about 5 years of dealing with progressively worse &#8220;anxiety&#8221; it got to the point where I would randomly feel so ill I couldn&#8217;t even leave the house. Finally in February of 2010 I woke up one day and felt like someone punched me in the stomach. It was so horrible and I just couldn&#8217;t shake the pain &#8211; I saw my doctor multiple times and they told me it was all anxiety related. </em></p>
<p><em>I realized after about two weeks of being so sick I could barely move with constant &#8220;panic attacks&#8221; that it would get worse every time I ate. So I immediately switch to something that would not upset my stomach like yogurt and bread. I ate just that for months &#8211; all the while my doctors were telling me it was all in my head and there was nothing wrong with my stomach. Over the last 3 years my diet varied slightly but as things got worse I was basically limited to a diet of white rice and chicken noodle soup (without the chicken) for the last two years. I saw 28 doctors in this time period who diagnosed me with all kinds of issues (all of them stemming from the root cause but no one able to tell me what that was) </em></p>
<p><em>Not only was I actually having allergic reactions to food, not panic attacks, but I started having them to touching things and smells as well. In January of this year I finally found a doctor that knew a little bit about what was going on with me and put me on many supplements &#8211; which have helped a lot. Right before I found that doctor I spent 4 days in the hospital because I couldn&#8217;t breathe (especially while trying to have a BM) and after they checked my heart they told me I was fine and to leave the hospital. When I begged the doctor not to make me leave because I knew I would die the doctor told me to go see a psychologist because there was nothing wrong with me. </em></p>
<p><em>Just this last Thursday I finally found an alternative medicine doctor/integrated medicine doctor that gave me all the answers I was looking for. After some tests I found out a few things: </em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>I have mercury poisoning &#8211; slowly leaking into my body every day for the last 11 years and more recently when I had a child during all this, my nutrition was so depleted that 3 more teeth broke down so I now have 4 fillings leaking into my body daily.</em></li>
<li><em>Because of the extreme poisoning it has broken down the lining of my stomach to the point where I have &#8220;leaky gut syndrome&#8221; or permeated stomach lining. All that time they told me I was having panic attacks and trying to put me on drugs it was actually food escaping into my body from my stomach and my body attacking it as a foreign invader. I&#8217;m lucky I never went into shock and it killed me.</em></li>
<li><em>So since my stomach lining was already weak, all the chemicals in our food/environment have caused me to develop Multiple chemical sensitivity, continued to deteriorate my stomach lining so I have a chronic Yeast infection in my stomach, my body is so over loaded by toxins that my liver and lymphatic system can barely push any of them out anymore and that by itself causes a whole host of other issues.</em></li>
<li><em>Not to mention the mercury that has accumulated in my body/brain is causing symptoms like Alzheimer and I&#8217;m only 31 years old.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>It will probably take years to rebuild my stomach, fix my teeth, clean all the mercury out of my body, and eliminate all the toxins, etc but at least now I know what is going on and I&#8217;m on the right track.</em><br />
<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, my out of pocket medical costs have bankrupted my family &#8211; literally since we were just evicted and are now living in a hotel with two of our four daughters. With that said I have made it my personal mission to destroy everyone and everything that contributed to this issue &#8211; from the bad food we so unknowingly consume, the products we use daily that are filled with cancer causing agents and other harmful products, the western medicine doctors that trying to treat all symptoms with a pill instead of fixing the root cause of the issue, etc. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070516181511/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/external/faq/mcss.htm" target="_blank">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> defines MCS: &#8220;The preferred medical term is Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance (IEI), which can be defined as a &#8220;chronic, recurring disease caused by a person&#8217;s inability to tolerate an environmental chemical or class of foreign chemicals.&#8221;   The site lists the following criteria for a diagnosis:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Symptoms are reproducible with repeated (chemical) exposures.</li>
<li>The condition is chronic.</li>
<li>Low levels of exposure (lower than previously or commonly tolerated) result in manifestations of the syndrome (i.e. increased sensitivity).</li>
<li>The symptoms improve, or resolve completely, when the triggering chemicals are removed.</li>
<li>Responses often occur to multiple chemically-unrelated substances.</li>
<li>Symptoms involve multiple-organ symptoms (runny nose, itchy eyes, headache, scratchy throat, ear ache, scalp pain, mental confusion or sleepiness, palpitations of the heart, upset stomach, nausea and/or diarrhea, abdominal cramping, aching joints).</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid being poisoned is to be labeled a kook, the one at office parties and family events who brings their own food, the target of sighs and eye rolls.  It is being the one who makes her own soap and cleaning products.   It is being that person who avoids so many of the things that are part of everyday life in America that she becomes an outcast.  We, in the &#8220;civilized world&#8221;, seem to be intent on being complicit in our own demise, paying our hard-earned money to inhale toxins and pollutants, to consume chemical concoctions instead of food, and to slather poison on our bodies to be introduced into our systems through the pores in our skin.</p>
<p>Whether you believe this is deliberate depopulation or careless disregard in the pursuit of the almighty dollar, there is little question that we are all victims of a toxic civilization.</p>
<p>This is our future, and no amount of cognitive dissonance, no loudly stated refusal to believe it, will make it go away.</p>

<p>Monsanto and their biotech buddies would have you believe that they are super-heroes, set on saving hungry children from starvation wearing a dazzling fake-green cape. In fact, in a recent <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/monsanto-hides-behind-cries-of-elitist-in-response-to-tremendous-global-social-media-movement-and-impending-day-of-protest-05162013#sthash.YU7VzeWP.dpuf" target="_blank">attack on activists</a>, Monsanto&#8217;s CEO Hugh Grant said that because critics &#8220;can afford&#8221; organic food, we don&#8217;t care about the plight of those who can&#8217;t afford it. “There is this strange kind of reverse elitism: If I’m going to do this, then everything else shouldn’t exist,” said Grant. “There is space in the supermarket shelf for all of us.”</p>
<p>Even Monsanto&#8217;s website is on the defense, with page after page attempting to justify what the biotech industry is doing to our food supply. It must be true if even leading &#8220;philanthropists&#8221; (and I use this term loosely) like <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/is-bill-gates-a-psychopath-04212012" target="_blank">Bill and Melinda Gates</a> are behind the distribution of Monsanto crops across the globe. Right?</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s all about the public&#8217;s perception. The push for acceptance of GMO foods has, thus far, been all about which team has the most money. Monsanto and their ilk can afford more television ads and more PR than anti-GMO activists can. Because the biotech companies, Big Food, and Big Agri can pay to spread their message, many people are convinced by their pure propaganda that GMOs are a necessary evil if the Third World is to avoid millions of slow, agonizing deaths by starvation. Because biotech is able to afford to blanket the media with their perspective, their view point is accepted as the correct one because that is the only perspective that many people ever hear.</p>
<p>But just because they shout the loudest, that doesn&#8217;t make it true.</p>
<p>How we address these misconceptions can mean the difference between swaying people to examine these claims more closely or causing them to stick their fingers in their ears and sing, &#8220;lalalalala&#8230;&#8221; to block us out. Here are some of the most common myths that Monsanto and friends would like you to believe about the wonderful world of GMOs.</p>
<h2>Myth #1: No one has ever proven that GMOs are harmful to people.</h2>
<p>Monsanto mouthpieces have been quoted time, time, and time again stating the untruth that genetically modified organisms have never been proven to harm people. It seems that they believe, like <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" target="_blank">Joseph Goebbels</a>, the uncontested King of Propaganda, that if you repeat a lie often enough, and with enough conviction, that it becomes the accepted truth.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong> Just a few of the results of a GMO diet (based on peer-reviewed studies) are: grotesque tumors, premature death, organ failure, gastric lesions, liver damage, kidney damage, severe allergic reactions, a viral gene that disrupts human functions…you can read more <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/gmos-not-even-in-moderation-02072013" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<h2>Myth #2: GMO crops are the only way to solve world hunger.</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The most common pro-GMO argument that you will hear these days is that genetically modified crops are the only way to feed the worlds burgeoning population. Without them, proponents claim that hunger will claim the lives of millions over the next decade. In the gospel of biotech, GMOs are the answer to world hunger. If you protest against GMO technology, you are cast as a cold-hearted elitist and the deaths of all of those suffering children in ***** (pick-a-3rd-world-country) rest firmly on your doorstep.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>: </strong></em>Sustainable agricultural practices are the answer to world hunger. GMO farming practices are not sustainable. Farmers who plant GMOs are not able to save their seeds from year to year due to patent infringement and poor fertility in the seeds. Therefore, after getting the first year of good harvests, the following year they must continue buying seeds, leading to perpetual debt and enough financial despair in India (the <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/monsantos-gmo-seeds-farmer-suicides-every-30-minutes/" target="_blank">Bt Cotton scandal</a>) that an Indian farmer took his own life every 30 minutes, after becoming the indentured servant of Monsanto and drowning in insurmountable debt. Well over a quarter of a million farmers died by suicide before the country <a href="http://www.politicolnews.com/india-state-bans-gmo-bt-cotton-licenses-permanently/" target="_blank">banned the sale of Bt cotton seeds</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://realchangenews.org/index.php/site/archives/7956" target="_blank">Real Change News </a>agrees that biotech farming methods are not the answer to world hunger. They recommend &#8220;agroecology&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Numerous reports from nonprofit, governmental and international organizations have concluded that food can be produced sustainably by bringing ecological principles to agriculture through a practice known as agroecology. The practice supports small-scale, traditional methods of farming and promotes crop diversity over a single-food crop, often referred to as a monoculture. Practicing agroecology also enables farmers to become independent and self-sufficient producers of natural, healthy foods.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Myth #3: GMOs need less pesticide spraying.</strong></h2>
<p>Monsanto claims that their Bt products require less spraying. It&#8217;s right <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/insect-resistance-management.aspx" target="_blank">HERE </a>on their website (emphasis mine):</p>
<p>Crops with a <i>Bt</i> trait have been modified to produce a protein that is toxic to various forms of insect larvae. <i>Bt</i> proteins have long been used as topical sprays in conventional and organic agriculture because they are effective and can be used safely. <strong>Crops that are genetically engineered to carry the <i>Bt</i> trait allow farmers to protect their crops while eliminating or significantly decreasing the amount of pesticides sprayed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>: Unfortunately, the best laid schemes of mice, men, and Monsanto often go awry. The Cornucopia Institute reports that was true for the first couple of years, but then use of pesticides and herbicides increased dramatically. (This, of course, resulted in a hefty profit for the producers of those chemicals who are&#8230;yep, you guessed it, Monsanto and the other biotech companies who produce the seeds.)</p>
<blockquote><p>But a <a title="Food &amp; Water Watch Superweeds" href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/reports/superweeds/" target="_blank">n</a><a title="Food &amp; Water Watch Superweeds" href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/reports/superweeds/" target="_blank">ew study</a> released by Food &amp; Water Watch yesterday finds the goal of reduced chemical use has not panned out as planned.  In fact, according to the USDA and EPA data used in the report, the <a title="ERS adoption of GMO crops in US" href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption.aspx#.UdGtl8u9KSM" target="_blank">quick adoption</a> of genetically engineered crops by farmers has increased herbicide use over the past 9 years in the U.S.  The report follows on the heels of another such<a title="“Impacts of genetically engineered crops on pesticide use in the U.S. – the first sixteen years” by Charles M. Benbrook" href="http://news.cahnrs.wsu.edu/2012/10/01/summary-of-major-findings-and-definitions-of-important-terms/" target="_blank"> study</a>  by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/colleges/washington-state-university/">Washington State University</a>research professor Charles Benbrook just last year.</p>
<p>Both reports focus on “superweeds.” It turns out that spraying a pesticide repeatedly selects for weeds which also resist the chemical.  Ever more resistant weeds are then  bred, able to withstand increasing amounts – and often different forms – of herbicide.</p>
<p>At the center of debate is the pesticide glyphosate, the active ingredient in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/monsanto/">Monsanto</a><a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/monsanto/">MON +2.23%</a>‘s Round Up.  Food &amp; Water Watch found that the “total volume of glyphosate applied to the three biggest GE crops — corn, cotton and soybeans — increased 10-fold from 15 million pounds in 1996 to 159 million pounds in 2012.”  Overall pesticide use decreased only in the first few years GE crops were used (42 percent between 1998 and 2001) and has since then risen by 26 percent from 2001 to 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other organizations concur and even the mainstream media has been forced to report that pesticide and herbicide usage is on the rise.  Check out these recent articles from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/pesticides-gmo-monsanto-roundup-resistance_n_1936598.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> and<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002" target="_blank"> Reuters</a> for more information.</p>
<h2><strong>Myth #4: GMO technology  is comparable to the cross-breeding that our ancestors did to create hardier versions of heritage crops. </strong></h2>
<p>Check out this condescending blurb, straight from the horse&#8217;s &#8230;ummm&#8230;.<em>mouth</em> (<a href="http://www.monsanto.com/improvingagriculture/Pages/modern-breeding-techniques.aspx" target="_blank">the Monsanto website</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Want to hear something extraordinary? Chances are, almost everything you’ve eaten in your entire life was genetically modified. The same was true for your parents…and your grandparents.</p>
<p>For more than 10,000 years, mankind has selectively bred plants and animals.  The cows you see in farmer’s fields bear little resemblance to the ancient Aurochs from which they descended. And the corn you eat is the domesticated version of a wild grass called teosinte.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong> </em>What our ancestors did, and what responsible farmers do, is cross-pollination of different varieties of the same plant. It is a low tech method that can occur naturally &#8211; but they just gave it a little bit of help in order to bring forth the desirable characteristics, like the drought-hardiness of one type of wheat combined with the shorter growing season required for another type of wheat. This is selective breeding. Genetically modifying seeds is a whole different ballgame, however. Here&#8217;s a great explanation from the <a href="http://www.foodrenegade.com/hybrid-seeds-vs-gmos/" target="_blank">Food Renegade website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike hybrid seeds, GMO seeds are not created using natural, low-tech methods. GMO seed varieties are <strong>created in a lab using high-tech and sophisticated techniques like gene-splicing</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GMO seeds seldom cross different, but related plants. Often the cross goes far beyond the bounds of nature so that instead of crossing two different, but related varieties of plant, they are<strong>crossing different biological kingdoms</strong> — like, say, a bacteria with a plant.</p>
<p>For example, Monsanto has crossed genetic material from a bacteria known as Bt (<em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>) with corn. The goal was to create a pest-resistant plant. This means that any pests attempting to eat the corn plant will die since the pesticide is part of every cell of the plant.</p>
<p>The resultant GMO plant, known as <em>Bt Corn</em>, is itself <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/pips/pip_list.htm">registered as a pesticide with the EPA</a>, along with other GMO Bt crops. In other words, if you feed this corn to your cattle, your chickens, or yourself, you’ll be feeding them an actual pesticide — not just a smidgeon of pesticide residue.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s even worse is that biotech has the ability to produce their seeds with a built in &#8220;terminator technology.&#8221; This means that the seeds cannot be saved from one year to the next (unlike the cross-pollinated seeds with which they try to claim kinship). Monsanto has patented the technology (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_use_restriction_technology" target="_blank">gene use restriction technology</a>) but claims not to use it. This would produce sterile, lifeless seeds that could not be reused, leaving the farmers utterly dependent on the biotech companies for future crops while providing an ongoing stream of income for those companies. At this point they maintain their monopoly through a series of contracts and patents that require the repurchase of seeds annually.</p>
<h2><strong>Myth #5: If the FDA and the USDA allow GMO&#8217;s, they must be safe to consume.</strong></h2>
<p>Organizations like the FDA, the EPA, and the USDA all wear a shiny halo. They receive their power and influence from the mere fact that the public believes that their number one priority is the health and safety of the citizens they are supposed to be serving. All of the agencies vow that they are there to protect the public on their websites:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194877.htm" target="_blank">FDA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring that foods (except for meat from livestock, poultry and some egg products which are regulated by the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>) are safe, wholesome, sanitary and properly labeled; ensuring that human and veterinary drugs, and vaccines and other biological products and medical devices intended for human use are safe and effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT" target="_blank">Vision Statement of the USDA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To expand economic opportunity through innovation, helping rural America to thrive; to promote agriculture production sustainability that better nourishes Americans while also helping feed others throughout the world; and to preserve and conserve our Nation&#8217;s natural resources through restored forests, improved watersheds, and healthy private working lands.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do" target="_blank">EPA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.  EPA&#8217;s purpose is to ensure that all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong></em> All of the above is just feel-good, warm and fuzzy rhetoric. Perhaps there are employees that truly believe in what they&#8217;re doing, but the leadership is as sickeningly tainted as Bt Corn.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Monsanto has been so successful in the courtroom has been the company’s incestuous ties to the US de facto government. Despite the blatant conflicts of interest, Monsanto executives have held Cabinet, judicial and policy-making positions in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations. When you’re sleeping with the enemy, the enemy tends to get away with all manner of crimes.</p>

</ul>
<p>Make no mistake, the commissioners, directors, and secretaries of these agencies are put in place for a reason. That reason is to grease the wheels for the wealthy biotech firms (and drug companies and Big Food companies and&#8230;well, you get the idea). Through an abuse of trust placed in them by the American people, they abuse their power and practice deception on the grandest scale imaginable.</p>
<p>If the FDA, USDA, or the EPA approve something, you might want to view it with more suspicion than acceptance. If they can say that radiation and pesticides are acceptable in your food, but that raw milk isn&#8217;t acceptable for consumption&#8230;well, there&#8217;s something incredibly wrong here.</p>

<h2><strong>Myth #6: There is no nutritional difference between GMO&#8217;s and non-GMO&#8217;s.</strong></h2>
<p>Biotech will tell you that there is absolutely no nutritional difference between genetically modified food and its organic counterpart. They will cite the calories, the fiber, and all of the macronutrients, pointing out that they are identical. They will scoff and roll their collective eyes at the &#8220;ignorance&#8221; of people who pay double to triple the price to avoid GMOs in their kitchens. Even television&#8217;s Dr. Oz came out on his show in support of the nutritional equality of GMO foods, saying that <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/dr-oz-organic-food-is-undemocratic" target="_blank">organic food was &#8220;undemocratic&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong></em> A shocking report released on the blog <a href="http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/stunning_corn_comparison_gmo_versus_non_gmo" target="_blank">Moms Across America</a> last March revealed that the nutritional differences in GMO vs non-GMO corn were astounding. The report was from the non-GMO corn company De Dell, in Canada. Not only are the nutritional values different, but the levels of poison in the corn are toxic:</p>
<blockquote><p>GMO Corn has 14 ppm of Calcium and NON GMO corn has 6130 ppm. 437 X more.</p>
<p>GMO corn has 2 ppm of Magnesium and NON GMO corn has 113ppm. 56 X more.</p>
<p>GMO corn has 2 ppm of Manganese and NON GMO corn has 14ppm. 7X more.</p>
<p>Look at the levels of Formaldehyde and Glyphosate IN the corn! The EPA standards for Glyphosate in water in America is .7ppm. European Tests showed organ damage to animals at .1pp<strong>b</strong> (.0001ppm) of Glyphosate in water. Our water levels allow glyphosate 7,000X higher than what has been shown to be toxic in animals. This corn has 13 ppm! 130,000 times higher than what is toxic in water!*</p>
<p>In a study that Dr. Huber reported, on Elizabeth Dougherty&#8217;s Talk Radio,  .97 ppm of formeldehyde showed to be toxic in ingestion to animals. This corn has 200X that! That is why the animals , given a choice will not eat it at all, they can smell the formeldehyde!</p></blockquote>
<p>There is more evidence of higher nutrient levels in non-GMO, organic foods:</p>

<h2><strong>Myth #7: GMOs are impossible to avoid.</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s true that GMOs lurk in over 70% of the processed foods that line the grocery store shelves. Even <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/07/14/gmos-researchers-debate-healthy-safety-genetically-modified-foods/" target="_blank">the mainstream media</a> has reported on the omnipresence of genetically modified ingredients. This makes it very difficult to avoid them.  The biotech companies have spent millions and millions of dollars in the fight against GMO labeling in an attempt to convince the public that the grocery costs will go up without their seeds.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong></em> It&#8217;s difficult but not impossible! Here are some <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/clean-your-kitchen-how-to-trash-the-toxins-inyour-pantry-01162013" target="_blank">tips to banish GMOs</a> from your kitchen once and for all:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Avoid all processed food. Every single bit of it. You don&#8217;t know what all of those scientific sounding ingredients are &#8211; and many of them are derived from things like GMO corn, soy, and canola.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Spend one week cooking from scratch to help identify the places that processed foods are sneaking in. </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Use only single ingredients for one week: flour, rice, oats, organic milk and yogurt, grass-fed meat, organic fruits and vegetables, and basic pantry supplies (yeast, baking soda, etc.).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Buy organic dry items like wheat, rice, and oats, in bulk.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Grow your own. No matter where you live, make an effort to grow as much of your own food as possible. Even a salad garden in a sunny windowsill is a start. This is the only way that you can truly know what you are eating.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Search out sources of real food near you. </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The next best option to your own garden is making friends with a local farmer at the market (find one </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://eatlocalgrown.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">) – you can purchase many things in bushels at a much better price than the 1 pint baskets. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Learn to preserve food. By canning, freezing, dehydrating, and root-cellaring, you can preserve your healthy harvests so that you are not hostage to the grocery stores in the non-growing months.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Know what ingredients are most likely to be GMO.  </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Over 85% of soy and corn in North America is GMO.  That means that if an item is not labeled “organic” and contains one of those ingredients (in its many different disguises) that you are consuming somebody’s science experiment.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Myth #8: Monsanto has our best interests in mind.</h2>
<p>All you need to do is read Monsanto&#8217;s website and it becomes clear. These people are the benevolent saviors of all mankind and their genetically modified seeds are the vehicle with which all of the world will be fed. Monsanto&#8217;s CEO <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/whoweare/Pages/corporate-sustainability-report.aspx" target="_blank">Hugh Grant writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The sustainability of agriculture is also central to our three-point vision—produce more, conserve more and improve lives. But it isn’t just a vision. It’s the heart of our business. Whether that is through our work in the field with farmers, or in the communities where we operate around the world, it is core to our global operations and is a priority for how we steward our business every day.</p>
<p align="left">Five years ago, Monsanto laid out an ambitious set of goals in sustainable agriculture focused on these key areas where our business could help to make a positive impact for farmers and broader society. We committed to support agriculture’s ability to produce more on the same footprint of land while conserving other natural resources. At that time, we also committed to help improve lives by supporting new tools and approaches to help lift smallholder farmers out of poverty and improve their overall prosperity. Today, the more than 21,000 men and women of Monsanto around the world continue this important work.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>: A German magazine, Sustainable Pulse, views it a little differently. Last week they came out with an article that outlined the mysterious mishaps that have been befalling activists and researchers across Europe. Here&#8217;s a link to the enlightening article (<a href="http://sustainablepulse.com/2013/07/13/the-sinister-monsanto-group-agent-orange-to-genetically-modified-corn/#.Ueq8KkEWLDu" target="_blank">English version</a>). Last month, just days before researchers were to present a damaging study, their computers were attacked by sophisticated hackers. The scheduled press conference had to be cancelled.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, there are studies which show that the product may damage plants and animals and the latest study shows that many large city inhabitants now have the field poison in their bodies, without knowing it.  Exactly what the spray can trigger in an organism is, as with so many things in this field, disputed.</p>
<p>Two days before the study across 18 countries was set to be published, a virus disabled the computer of the main organiser, Adrian Bepp. There was a threat that press conferences in Vienna, Brussels and Berlin would be cancelled. “We panicked”, remembers Heike Moldenhauer from BUND. The environmental activists were under extreme time pressure.</p>
<p>Moldenhauer and her colleagues have widely speculated about the motives and identity of the mysterious attacker.  The genetic engineering expert at BUND believes the unknown virus suppliers wanted in particular to “generate confusion”.  Nothing is worse for a study than a cancelled press conference: “we did ask ourselves at the time if we were seeing ghosts”, said Moldenhauer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article above also speculates that the US government itself is on board with spying on anti-Monsanto activists&#8230;it&#8217;s a must-read.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more. This do-good company has <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/why-does-monsanto-need-an-army-of-mercenary-soldiers-05222013" target="_blank">hired the notorious mercenaries</a> from the former Blackwater to help deal with activists. <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/154739/blackwaters-black-ops" target="_blank">An article</a> by Jeremy Scahill of the Nation explains that Monsanto has already given them over half a million dollars to help deal with activists:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to internal Total Intelligence communications, biotech giant Monsanto—the world’s largest supplier of genetically modified seeds—hired the firm in 2008–09. The relationship between the two companies appears to have been solidified in January 2008 when Total Intelligence chair Cofer Black traveled to Zurich to meet with Kevin Wilson, Monsanto’s security manager for global issues.</p>
<p>After the meeting in Zurich, Black sent an e-mail to other Blackwater executives, including to Prince and Prado at their Blackwater e-mail addresses. Black wrote that Wilson “understands that we can span collection from internet, to reach out, to boots on the ground on legit basis protecting the Monsanto [brand] name…. Ahead of the curve info and insight/heads up is what he is looking for.” Black added that Total Intelligence “would develop into acting as intel arm of Monsanto.” Black also noted that Monsanto was concerned about animal rights activists and that they discussed how Blackwater “could have our person(s) actually join [activist] group(s) legally.” Black wrote that initial payments to Total Intelligence would be paid out of Monsanto’s “generous protection budget” but would eventually become a line item in the company’s annual budget. He estimated the potential payments to Total Intelligence at between $100,000 and $500,000. According to documents, Monsanto paid Total Intelligence $127,000 in 2008 and $105,000 in 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>Monsanto is taking surreptitious action against the movement, whether on their own or through the use of “contractors”. They have engaged in a <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/monsanto-declares-social-media-war-against-protesters-05212013" target="_blank">social media war against activists</a>.  Mysterious things have been occurring on the social networks: posts have disappeared, some posts are hidden from the timelines of readers, and trolls abound on pages like <a href="http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/" target="_blank">March Against Monsanto</a> and <a href="http://occupymonsanto360.org/blog/" target="_blank">Occupy Monsanto</a>. Readers often have difficulty sharing pertinent anti-GMO articles on social media. The internet war is ON.</p>
<h2>Myth #9: GMOs are not harmful to the environment.</h2>
<p>Biotech would have you believe that the farming of GMOs is as green an industry as organic farming, bringing prosperity and abundance to all.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong><em>The reality</em></strong>:</strong></em> We need look no further than the <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/crimes-against-humanity-how-monsanto-is-turning-a-hawaiian-island-into-a-petri-dish-complete-with-human-lab-rats-06132013" target="_blank">island of Molokai in Hawaii</a> to see the horrible environmental damage wrought by Monsanto. Air quality and water quality are deadly because of Monsanto&#8217;s almost-2000 acre test facility. The story of the island is heartbreaking: people are dying horrible deaths, infertility is rampant, and other farms are being tainted by cross pollination from the frankencorn growing there. Workers wear head to toe protective gear during spraying, including respirators. Nearby residents, however, are not provided with such equipment and have no option but to breathe in the toxic dust that comes from the fields. This is not merely anecdotal to the small island &#8211; worldwide, many areas around GMO farms report horrific bloody skin rashes, an uptick in asthma, and toxic pesticides that leach into the groundwater.</p>
<h2><strong>Myth #10: Get used to it. GMOs are here to stay.  </strong></h2>
<p>Biotech wants you to believe that there is no sense in fighting them. They want you to just accept what they have to say and eat their tainted products. They hope that people feel like they are too powerful to fight and like the battle has already been won.</p>
<p><strong><em>The reality:</em></strong> There is a war against GMOs and we, the resistance, are gaining ground. By sharing information like this and informing the public of the poisons that are being grown in our own back yard, we can fight back against biotech. By using the power of social media, by organizing and demonstrating like millions of people did during the March Against Monsanto, we can say no.</p>
<p>By refusing to purchase any products that contain GMOs , by refusing to consume GMOs at restaraunts, and by spreading the word about the dangers, we can make a difference. By educating the public and letting them know that we have been deceived by the biotech industry, by Big Agri, and by Big Food, and that we have been betrayed by the elected officials and the agencies of our own government, we can stand united against these monolithic companies. We can remind them that the only way they will stay in business is if we, the consumers, purchase their products, and that we, the consumers, will not allow them to poison our families and our environment anymore.</p>
<h2>Become a grocery store revolutionary.</h2>
<p>This is war. If something could mean the difference between life and death for your children, between health and disease, between fertility or barrenness, wouldn&#8217;t you do anything to keep them safe? That&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t just sit there and watch this go on from the sidelines, shaking our heads.</p>
<p>It really <em>is</em> as simple as just saying no to GMOs but we all have to do it. We have to refuse to eat these so-called foods and we have to let people know why. We have to publicly expose these myths for the fiction that they are. We have to use social media, talk to our friends, demonstrate, write letters to the editor&#8230;we have to shine the light on the lies. Education and information are the weapons for this fight.</p>
<p>Make no mistake &#8211; the encroaching takeover of our food supply is an extinction level event. Will you just watch it happen?</p>

<p>If you are a vegetable gardener, chances are you have experienced such an abundance of zucchini so great that even a ravenous family of squash lovers could never keep up with it.  Right now, the garden is simply loaded with the prolific dark green veggies.  And if not, you can pick up baskets full of them at a great price at your local market. (You can find a nearby farmer’s market <a href="http://eatlocalgrown.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>)</p>
<p><em><strong>Some zucchini trivia</strong></em>:  Biologically, zucchinis are closely related to cucumbers and watermelons.  Zucchini is technically a fruit and not a vegetable.  They have been consumed in Central and South America, as well as Italy, for thousands of years, but only became popular in North America over the past 50 years, perhaps when gardeners realized what a bounty they could receive in a tiny amount of garden space.  Zucchini is part of what is known by the Native Americans as the &#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; &#8211; three plants that grow well together &#8211; corn, summer squash, and beans.</p>
<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Zucchini is chock full of nutrients!</p>
<ul>
<li>A huge 1 cup serving of zucchini, including the skin, contains: 20 calories, 1.5 grams of protein, 4.2 grams of carbohydrates, and 1.4 grams of fiber.</li>
<li>Zucchini was proven in studies to be a top food source for antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha carotene, and beta carotene.</li>
<li>Zucchini is extremely high in natural pectin, which provides protection against diabetes and can help regulate insulin and blood sugar levels.</li>
<li>Zucchini contains Vitamins C, B6, B2, A, and K, as well as manganese, potassium, magnesium, folate, and phosphorus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Growing Zucchini</h2>
<p>Zucchini is not just easy to grow &#8211; it can actually take over your garden if you&#8217;re not careful!  Some people plant zucchini away from other  parts of the garden for this reason.  You should allow plenty of room for the vines to spread. If you are using the square foot gardening method, thin to one plant per square foot.</p>
<h2>Preparing Fresh Zucchini</h2>
<p>Zucchini is one of those multi-purpose harvests that can be used in a variety of ways.  Whether you prefer it sweet or savory, there&#8217;s a place for zucchini in your kitchen.<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/huge-zuke.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1818" alt="huge zuke" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/huge-zuke-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" /></a></p>
<p>If you end up with one of the baseball bat zucchinis hiding under the leaves in your garden, cut out the center and remove the seeds.  Very large zucchini can become woody and flavorless.  Try using over-large zucchini in recipes that call for shredded zucchini &#8211; this helps to mask the texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shredded-zucchini.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1819" alt="shredded zucchini" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shredded-zucchini-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Try using shredded zucchini in place of recipes that call for shredded potatoes. You can also mix shredded zucchini half and half with shredded potatoes to make hash browns or potato patties.  Because zucchini is so abundant and the uses are so varied, the recipes for its use are in a separate article&#8230;find them below.</p>
<p>Slice a zucchini in half and fill it with all manner of sweet or savory fillings to make baked zucchini boats.</p>
<p>Uncooked ucchini spears are great for dipping and make a tasty addition to a veggie tray.  If the zucchini is a small, tender fruit, you can leave the peel on for an extra hit of fiber.  For a bigger zucchini, it&#8217;s best to peel it for use raw, because the skin will be tough and unpleasant in texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/zuke-spears.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1820" alt="zuke spears" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/zuke-spears-300x234.jpg" width="300" height="234" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 19px;">Preserving Zucchini</span></strong></p>
<h3>Dehydration</h3>
<p>Zucchini can be dehydrated either in thin slices or shredded.  Either way, prep your zucchini, then mix well with salt.  Place the salted zucchini in a colander over a bowl and put it in the refrigerator for a minimum of two hours. (I usually leave it overnight).  This will remove a great deal of the moisture. Put a thin layer of zucchini on the shelves of your dehydrator and dry overnight on low, or until the zucchini is completely dry.  When you&#8217;re ready to use it, reconstitute it by covering it in boiling water for 15 minutes.  Drain and use as you would fresh zucchini.</p>
<h3>Freezing</h3>
<p>Unlike most vegetables, there is no need to blanch zucchini before freezing it.  Simply shred it, drain it (don&#8217;t add salt in case you want to use it in sweet dishes like zucchini bread or muffins) and then place it on a cookie sheet in a single layer.  Put this in the freezer for two hours, then relocate the frozen shreds into large freezer bags.</p>
<h3>Canning</h3>
<p>Zucchini really doesn&#8217;t take to canning well. However, you can use it in place of cucumbers for your favorite pickle  or relish recipes.  The large zucchinis that are a little bit tougher actually work better for zucchini pickles because they hold their firmness better. If you don&#8217;t have a favorite pickle recipe, you can try putting up some jars of this spicy sweet pickle.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A polio vaccine injection that was given to people between 1955-1963 contained a live cancer virus.  Here is a cached copy of the <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8pUR6KX_Vq8J:www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/updates/archive/polio_and_cancer_factsheet.htm+cdc+polio+cancer+fact+sheet&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca" target="_blank">CDC document</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine Fact Sheet</h3>
<ul>
<li>SV40 is a virus found in some species of monkey.</li>
<li>SV40 was discovered in 1960. Soon afterward, the virus was found in polio vaccine.</li>
<li>More than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine from 1955 to 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; it has been estimated that 10–30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of vaccine.</li>
<li>SV40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans, but it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.</li>
<li>The majority of scientific evidence suggests that SV40-contaminated vaccine did not cause cancer; however, some research results are conflicting and more studies are needed.</li>
<li>Polio vaccines being used today do not contain SV40. All of the current evidence indicates that polio vaccines have been free of SV40 since 1963.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the 1950s, rhesus monkey kidney cells, which contain SV40 if the animal is infected, were used in preparing polio vaccines. Because SV40 was not discovered until 1960, no one was aware in the 1950s that polio vaccine could be contaminated.</li>
<li>SV40 was found in the injected form of the polio vaccine (IPV), not the kind given by mouth (OPV).</li>
<li>Not all doses of IPV were contaminated. It has been estimated that 10–30 million people actually received a vaccine that contained SV40.</li>
<li>Some evidence suggests that receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine may increase risk of cancer. However, the majority of studies done in the U.S. and Europe which compare persons who received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine with those who did not have shown no causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">So&#8230;.more than 50 years after the fact, the CDC quietly admits that this vaccine could have kept folks from getting polio but may have given them cancer instead??????????????</span></p>
<p>A peer reviewed paper from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16288015" target="_blank">Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center at Loyola University</a> confirms this.  According to the research, the procedure used to inactivate the virus was not effective.</p>
<blockquote><p>We determined that the procedure used by this manufacturer to inactivate SV40 in oral poliovirus vaccine seed stocks based on heat inactivation in the presence of MgCl2 did not completely inactivate SV40. These SV40-contaminated vaccines were produced from early 1960s to about 1978 and were used throughout the world. Our findings underscore the potential risks of using primary monkey cells for preparing poliovirus vaccines, because of the possible contamination with SV40 or other monkey viruses, and emphasize the importance of using well-characterized cell substrates that are free from adventitious agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah, the Healthy Home Economist, broke the story yesterday. She wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This story is not new – many of of us who thoroughly researched the vaccination issue before choosing whether or not to immunize were already aware of this fact years ago.</p>
<p>I became aware of the tainted polio vaccines from 1955-1963 in the late 1990′s and it was one of the primary motivators for me to choose a “no shots, no way” approach for my children.</p>
<p>What <strong>is</strong> new is that the CDC is finally admitting it.</p>
<p>What took you so long CDC? Many of the folks vaccinated with the tainted polio stock are already <strong>dead</strong> from cancer with many more getting diagnosed each and every day! (<a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/it-only-took-50-years-cdc-admits-polio-vaccine-tainted-with-cancer-causing-virus/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like today, parents then were terrified and guilted into providing their child with the polio vaccine. By doing so, they may have saved that child from polio but sentenced them to a different early death from cancer.  Up to 30 million people may have been affected by this vaccine that was forced upon them by the government.  And the thing is, no amount of parental research can protect a child from something like this &#8211; if a substance is injected into your child, you have to take it on faith as to the ingredients in that hypodermic needle.  Do you really trust the government and Big Pharma with your child&#8217;s life?</p>
<p>The most frightening part of all is that in many parts of the world, this vaccine was mandatory.  Much like the people forced to take a flu shot to retain their jobs, children forced to take a series of vaccinations to attend school, or a host of other &#8220;health benefits&#8221; being foisted upon us, a deadly virus was injected into millions of kids around the world, whether they wanted it or not.  Let this be a lesson as you listen to the pediatrician tell you about the mandatory shots they want to give to your child &#8211; the HPV, the childhood immunization series, and the annual flu shot. Don&#8217;t forget those <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/sweden-a-cautionary-tale-about-vaccines-01232013" target="_blank">shots that are rushed to market </a>in the face of some horrible epidemic. Anything could be in those little vials and 50 years down the road, your children might discover that they too were poisoned, whether through a tragic laboratory mistake, a deliberate <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/the-great-american-genocide-07032013" target="_blank">depopulation maneuver</a>, or even a twisted human experiment.</p>
<p>And who is being held accountable for this?  Who is going to jail for committing murder on such a massive scale?  Who is being charged with negligence for allowing this to happen?  Who is being taken to task for making this toxic vaccine mandatory?</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;as usual&#8230;.no one.</p>

<p>Except, as any mom or dad who has ever raised a child through the toddler years will recognize, they aren&#8217;t really &#8220;riots&#8221; but temper tantrums.  It is like a bunch of hungry, overtired children, melting down and having a big, screaming hissy fit.</p>
<p>Basically, these people who are angry about the Zimmerman verdict are stomping their feet, running around, shouting, crying, and breaking things&#8230;just because they&#8217;re mad.</p>
<p>They are doing absolutely nothing that will effect a change, nothing that will increase their own credibility, and nothing that will prove to the world that they are right and the Zimmerman jury was wrong.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t peaceful protests with large numbers of citizens standing in unity get across the point that they are trying to prove with more clarity?  Aren&#8217;t these people trying to show that an injustice was done, that Zimmerman should not have been fearful of Trayvon Martin?  By rioting through city streets, threatening and hurting innocent bystanders, aren&#8217;t these &#8220;protesters&#8221; proving the complete opposite of their alleged point?</p>

<p>With this complete lack of dignity, you can&#8217;t even call these actions &#8220;protests&#8221; &#8211; you have to call them what they are &#8211; temper tantrums.  Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>From Los Angeles</p>
<blockquote><p>Several protesters ran into a Wal-Mart store and knocked down displays before store security chased them out. Police began guarding the door.</p>
<p>Tonya Williams was shopping with her daughter when the protesters burst in and security briefly locked down the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we were going to be stuck in there,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We saw the merchandise all thrown around. They had pulled the rack down, and there was merchandise all over the floor.&#8221;  (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-protesters-raid-la-store-075210080.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Dozens of demonstrators briefly blocked all lanes of Interstate 880 at the tail end of rush hour, stopping traffic in both directions for several minutes before lanes were cleared by authorities. Several protesters laid their bicycles on the ground in front of stopped cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go. You will go to jail,&#8221; one police officer shouted at demonstrators who were blocking traffic, the Oakland Tribune reported. However, police decided not to make arrests as the marchers, chanting &#8220;Justice for Trayvon Martin,&#8221; were directed back to surface streets.</p>
<p>Later, another group tried to march up the onramp to Interstate 580 before being turned away by Oakland police and California Highway Patrol officers.

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Also from Oakland:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporters were also a target in Oakland&#8230;but why?  Those are the people who were there to do what the protests were allegedly supposed to do &#8211; get the story out about the outrage at the verdict:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;a small number of Oakland demonstrators — some hiding their faces with bandanas, as demonstrators did during the <a id="EVGAP00020" title="Occupy Oakland" href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics/activism/protest/occupy-oakland-EVGAP00020.topic">Occupy Oakland</a> melees — turned violent late Sunday, setting upon an Oakland Tribune photographer and KTVU cameraman with kicks and punches.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m OK, but protesters had our photog on the ground,” Bay Area News Group reporter Natalie Neysa Alund <a href="https://twitter.com/nataliealund">tweeted</a> a little before 11:30 p.m. Sunday. “I tried to get them off him. An #SFgate photog came to the rescue — 1 camera is destroyed.”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, another reporter with the news group — which publishes the Oakland Tribune, Contra Costa Times and San Jose Mercury News — followed up: “Just patched up my assailed colleague. He&#8217;s shaken but not stirred. Should be ok. Senseless.”</p>
<p>A KTVU tweet said that news agency’s cameraman was also “attacked by masked protesters.” (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-oakland-protesters-angered-by-zimmerman-acquittal-rough-up-news-photographers-20130715,0,3507597.story?track=rss" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the riots resulted in serious harm&#8230;but what is the point of injuring a person because of the color of his skin? Isn&#8217;t that what the &#8220;protesters&#8221; are protesting <strong><em>against</em></strong>?</p>
<p>From Baltimore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real estate agent Christina Dudley said she was walking to her car just before 9 p.m. when she saw several young black males and two black females chasing a 37-year-old Hispanic man west on North Linwood Avenue past East Fairmont Avenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the boys had a handgun out and it was pointed at the back of him,&#8221; Dudley said in an interview.</p>
<p>They caught up to the man at the corner of Fairmount and N. Streeper Street, and the male with the gun beat the victim with what appeared to be his gun while others kicked and stomped him, Dudley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were just yelling and calling him names as they ran after him, but once they were hitting him and after that they started yelling, &#8220;This is for Trayvon, [expletive],&#8221; said Dudley, who heard the chant repeated multiple times. (<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-monday-20130715,0,5135359.story#ixzz2ZERHMWB3" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>From Mississippi:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man who says he was jogging alongside of a road when three black men abducted and beat him claims the alleged attack was in retaliation for George Zimmerman’s acquittal, police in Senatobia, Miss. told Fox News.</p>
<p>Police Chief Steve Holts told Fox News the alleged victim, who is white, was jogging Sunday night along Highway 51 when, he said, the suspects pulled over and ordered him to get inside their car.</p>
<p>“One of them asked, ‘Do you know who Trayvon Martin was?’” Holts quoted the man as saying.  At that point, the men in the vehicle allegedly attacked him.</p>
<p>The man, who the chief described as a young resident of  the area, was treated  at a local hospital.</p>
<p>Memphis television station WREG reported the assailants allegedly told the victim, “This is for Trayvon.” The television station and The Democrat newspaper reported the jogger was badly beaten and later dropped off on a road between Senatobia and Coldwater, Miss. (<a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/22850763/jogger-says-he-was-attacked-in-retaliation-for-zimmerman-verdict#axzz2Z8TvGzrd" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">So, clearly, it should be judged a hate crime when George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, but tit should be considered an act of protest when they beat up a bystander &#8220;for Trayvon&#8221; , selecting their victim just because he happens to be white or Hispanic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who are peacefully protesting the verdict, as is their Constitutionally protected right to do.  Unfortunately, the positivity and unity that they are trying to convey is being overridden by a bunch of kids having a tantrum. As Ted Nugent wrote, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Martin Luther King Jr. is rolling over in his grave that he sacrificed his life for the cause of judging people by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, as so many of his own race carry in in self-destructive behavior while professional race mongers blame everything on racism.&#8221; (Check out his essay on the subject of the Zimmerman verdict </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-verdict-vindicates-citizen-patrols-self-defense/" target="_blank">HERE</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">.)</span></p>
<p>The people participating in this big national melt-down are actually doing more to vindicate George Zimmerman&#8217;s actions last February than the jury did when they acquitted him.  They are, without direct provocation, destroying property, committing arson, beating the daylights out of people because of their skin color, and purposely attempting to incite fear.  They are perpetuating the racial stereotypes they claim to be railing against.</p>
<p>So, judging by these childish and vicious tantrums, why <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> people be feeling rather suspicious?</p>
<p>Someone needs to take away their spray paint and their matches, and then send them to their rooms so the adults can have a conversation.</p>

<p>The verdict is in for George Zimmerman and the mainstream media and the Hollywood puppets are yet again trying to tell us how to think.</p>
<p>Last night, the <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/zimmerman-verdict-not-guilty_072013" target="_blank">jury decided that George Zimmerman was not guilty of murder </a>in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin last February. Days before the decision, social media had erupted with threats of <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/panthers-this-time-were-going-out-to-whiteys-suburbs-and-burning-down-his-community_07112013" target="_blank">violence and riots</a> if the verdict came back in favor of Zimmerman.</p>
<p>This morning, the media is filled with perceived outrage. Here are the headlines on this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> main page:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Not Guilty&#8230;But Not Innocent</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>No Justice, No Peace: What I&#8217;ve Felt and What Is Next in the Wake of the Trayvon Martin Verdict</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, Huff Post has no headlines with a bias <em>towards</em> the Zimmerman verdict. The balance is all shifted against him.</p>
<p>Then there are the outraged celebrity statements.</p>
<p>First of all, Beyonce had a moment of silence to &#8220;honor&#8221; Trayvon Martin:</p>
<blockquote><p>After asking the crowd to be silent for a moment, she sang the chorus of &#8220;I Will Always Love You,&#8221; a song written by country music star Dolly Parton and brought to a global audience by the late Whitney Houston, before transitioning into her hit &#8220;Halo.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57593646/beyonce-holds-moment-of-silence-for-trayvon-martin/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Young Jeezy wrote a song, “It’s a Cold World (A Tribute to Trayvon Martin)&#8221;, that he posted to Facebook, with the following comment:</p>
<blockquote><p> “I am in no way shape, form, or fashion … trying to capitalize off of the latest series of events. These are my true feelings and my form of expression about it.” (<a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/07/14/celebrities-react-to-zimmerman-verdict/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Producer and entrepeneur Russell Simmons took to his blog stating that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;he’d be supporting the Trayvon Martin Foundation in helping to repeal laws like Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. He signed off, “God bless you little brother. Rest in peace.” (<a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/07/14/celebrities-react-to-zimmerman-verdict/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Even more preposterous are the tweets.</p>

<p>The question is, are the opinions of the celebrities their own, or are these just more &#8220;endorsements&#8221; paid for by the US government? Of course, they wouldn&#8217;t disclose that, would they? I wonder what the going rate for selling your soul on Twitter is these days.</p>
<p>It might sound far fetched to say that the government is paying for these &#8220;opinions&#8221; but some recently released smoking gun evidence makes a good case for the premise that the government hopes to initiate a race war and the chaos that will follow.</p>

<p>What is truly questionable is the reason that the government and the media would want to change public opinion. What are they trying to cover up? Is this a giant distraction from the ongoing scandals in Washington DC? Or is it a sinister step towards inciting enough chaos to justify the institution of martial law? Mike Rivero of <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/content/documents-obtained-judicial-watch-detail-role-justice-department-organizing-trayvon-martin-0#new" target="_blank">What Really Happened</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot emphasize enough that right now the US GovernmentWANTS race riots in cities across America, to distract from IRS-gate, to distract from DOJ-gate, to distract from NSA-gate, to distract from PRISM-gate, to distract from Benghazi-gate, to distract from EA-gate, to justify declaration of a National Emergency, to justify suspension of the Constitution, to justify a gun-grab, to have a small civil unrest to brutally put down to discourage a much lager uprising of the entire population the government could not hope to deal with. Too much corporate media focus has been put on this one case, with far to much emphasis on the racial overtones. Too many suspicious Facebook posts and tweets keep selling the idea that a Zimmerman acquittal will or should trigger mass riots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opinions are going to vary about the verdict &#8211; this is evident in the surveys across the internet, where people are divided almost evenly between guilty, not guilty, and undecided. The beauty of a somewhat &#8220;free&#8221; country is that we are all allowed to make our own decisions on how we feel about these things. Unfortunately, that freedom is circumvented when we are being manipulated, brainwashed, and sold an opinion via popular culture. When the Ministry of Propaganda writes a script, it&#8217;s awfully difficult to veer too far from the &#8220;information&#8221; that is blanketing the media.</p>
<p>Whatever your thoughts happen to be about the verdict, be sure that your opinion is your own. When you recognize the tactics that are being used to change the public mindset, it helps to immunize you against the propaganda techniques that are being put forth.</p>
<p>Are you a puppet? It&#8217;s not actually YOUR opinion if someone else does your thinking for you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The instructions for basic jams are all pretty much the same – you only need to make minor modifications for different fruits.  So, because we’re all creative people, I’m laying out the basic how-to, giving you a chart with special instructions fruit by fruit, and you can take it from there.</span></p>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>8 cups of fresh or frozen fruit</li>
<li>1 packet of pectin + ¼ of a package (I like to use the no-sugar-needed, but then still add sugar – just less!)</li>
<li>4 cups of sugar</li>
<li>2 tbsp- 1/4 cup of lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
<div></div>
<p>1.      Prep your fruit by washing it and cutting it up if necessary.</p>
<p>2.     Smush your fruit.  You can do this with a potato masher, food processer, blender or food mill.  For some fruits I like to puree them and have a smoother jam and for others I like chunkier jam – it’s up to personal preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t472/shotofespresso/food%20-%20prepping/blueberryandraspberryjams017.jpg" width="240" height="320" /></div>
<div></div>
<p>3.     In a small bowl, use a fork to mix ¼ cup of the sugar with one packet of pectin.</p>
<p>4.     In a saucepan, stir the fruit, lemon juice and pectin together well.</p>
<p>5.     Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.</p>
<p>6.    Once it is boiling, stir in the sugar and return to a boil for one minute.</p>
<div></div>

<p>7.     This is important:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong>Jam Making Rule of Law: </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Always test your jam!!!!  </strong></p>
<p align="center">How?</p>
<p align="center">You do this by keeping a spoon in the freezer &#8211; to test, drip a bit of the hot jam into the spoon to allow it to quick cool &#8211; the consistency it reaches is the consistency your finished product will be.  At this point, I nearly always end up adding another 1/4 &#8211; 1/2 package of pectin &#8211; I use the cheaper pectin to &#8220;top it up&#8221; &#8211; return to a simmer for a couple of minutes and test again.   Omitting this step may result in a very tasty ice cream topping or waffle syrup, but not jam!</p>

<p>8.  Ladle the jam carefully into your awaiting (<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012" target="_blank">sanitized</a>) jars, wipe the rims and cap your jars with snap lids and rings.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you are using more than one fruit in your jam, follow the instructions for the fruit that takes the longest to process.  For example, if you are making a blackberry and plum jam, process for 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.</p>

<p>We have recently moved to an area where blackberries grow wild to the extent that they are considered an invasive plant by many people. An untouched patch of blackberry bramble runs amok in the back yard and the fruit is currently a sweet daily bounty.  If you don&#8217;t have them growing in your own garden, look for them right now at your local farmer&#8217;s market. (Find a market <a href="http://eatlocalgrown.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>)</p>
<p><em><strong>Some blackberry trivia</strong></em>:  Ancient civilizations did not cultivate blackberries, rather they gathered them from the wild.  Folklore in the UK claims that blackberries belong to the devil after Michaelmas and thus should not be picked after Oct. 11.  Early explorers of North America found them to grow prolifically in the Southern colonies and in California.  They are a native plant on every continent except for Antarctica and Australia. Other names for blackberries include brambleberries, dewberries, and thimbleberries.</p>
<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Any fruit that is particularly rich in color is also particularly rich in nutrients, and the humble blackberry is no exception.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberries are loaded with minerals, particularly </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">potassium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, and calcium.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberries have one of the highest levels of antioxidants found in any fruits. Anti-oxidants improve the immune function and help lower your risk of developing cancer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberries are high in </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">vitamin C</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">vitamin K</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, and </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">folic acid.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The seeds of blackberries hold the key to important nutrients like </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">omega-3</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">and -6 fatty acids, </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> as well as some </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">protein</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">dietary fiber</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">carotenoids</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, ellagitannins and </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">ellagic acid.</span></li>
<li>One cup of blackberries contains 62 calories, 13.8 grams of carbs, a whopping 7.6 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All parts of the blackberry plant have long been used for their medicinal properties.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberry roots are astringent and can be used as a treatment for diarrhea. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The berries themselves contain high levels of s</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">alicylic acid, which gives them similar properties to aspirin, such as pain relief and fever relief.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The leaves can be chewed or made into a tea to treat mild inflammation of the gums or sore throats.</span></li>
<li>Blackberry juice is a soothing treatment for hemorrhoids.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 19px; font-size: 1.5em;">Using Fresh </span><span style="line-height: 19px; font-size: 1.5em;">Blackberries</span></strong></p>
<p>Many of the ideas here can be used interchangeably with blackberries, boysenberries, or raspberries,  depending on your local harvest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blackberries.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1779" alt="blackberries" src="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blackberries-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Gently wash your blackberries in cool water and put them in a colander to drain.  Use them immediately after washing them for the best texture.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberries make a wonderful addition to a fruit salad, a topping for ice cream or shortcake, or as a delicious, finger-staining snack. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Add blackberries to iced tea or lemonade for a refreshing summer drink.  Smash them gently with a fork to release more blackberry flavor into the drink.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Substitute blackberries for blueberries in your favorite muffin or pancake recipe.</span></li>

<h2>Preserving Blackberries</h2>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 19px;">Freezing</span></h3>
<p>To freeze fresh blackberries, wash them gently, then pat them dry. Place them on a cookie sheet in a single layer and place this in the freezer for two hours.  Store the frozen berries in large freezer bags.</p>
<h3>Canning</h3>
<p>Blackberries may be canned in syrup for use later in pies, cobblers or crisps.  The canned berries also make a delicious ice cream or pancake topping.</p>
<p><strong><em>Syrup Ingredients:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1cup of crushed blackberries (you can also puree them)</li>
<li>8 cups of water</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Syrup Directions</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Bring the water to a boil</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Stir in the sugar and crushed berries</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Continue to stir until all of the sugar is dissolved and the crushed berries are well incorporated.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the raw pack method for canning blackberries.  Berries are very delicate and do far better when canned using this method.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Blackberries</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lemon Juice</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Syrup</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Directions</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Add two tsp of lemon juice to the bottom of each <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012" target="_blank">sanitized jar</a>.</li>
<li>Place the berries into your jars, allowing 1 inch of headspace for expansion.</li>
<li> Cover the berries with boiling syrup.  Wipe the rim and cap your jars with snap lids and rings.</li>
<li>Process in a<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-pressure-canning-12152012" target="_blank"> pressure canner</a> for 30 minutes, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-altitude-adjustment-12152012" target="_blank">adjusting for altitude</a>.</li>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Blackberry Jam</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8 cups of blackberries</li>
<li>1 packet of pectin + ¼ of a package (I like to use the no-sugar-needed, but then still add sugar – just less!)</li>
<li>4 cups of sugar (I use organic turbinado sugar)</li>
<li>1 tbsp of lemon juice (you can use more if you want the jam to have a lemon-y flavor &#8211; up to 1/4 of a cup)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Prep your blackberries by washing them.  Some people like to remove the seeds but this is a matter of personal preference.</li>
<li>Smush your berries.  You can do this with a potato masher, food processer, blender or food mill.  Some people like to puree them and have a smoother jam and others like chunkier jam – it’s also up to personal preference.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, use a fork to mix ¼ cup of the sugar with one packet of pectin.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, stir the fruit, lemon juice and pectin together well.</li>
<li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.</li>
<li>Once it is boiling, stir in the sugar and return to a boil for one minute.</li>
<li>Test your jam…(see below!)  If isn’t the proper consistency add the other quarter packet of pectin, simmer for another minute, then retest.</li>
<li> Ladle the jam carefully into your awaiting<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-jar-prep-12152012" target="_blank"> sanitized jars</a>, wipe the rim and cap your jars with snap lids and rings.</li>
<li>Process in a<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-water-bath-canning-12152012" target="_blank"> water bath canner</a> for 10 minutes, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/canning-101-altitude-adjustment-12152012" target="_blank">adjusting for altitude</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><b>Jam Making Rule of Law: </b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Always test your jam!!!!  </b></p>
<p align="center">How?</p>
<p align="center">You do this by keeping a spoon in the freezer – to test, drip a bit of the hot jam into the spoon to allow it to quick cool – the consistency it reaches is the consistency your finished product will be.  At this point, I nearly always end up adding another 1/4 – 1/2 package of pectin – I use the cheaper pectin to “top it up” – return to a simmer for a couple of minutes and test again.   Omitting this step may result in a very tasty ice cream topping or waffle syrup, but not jam!</p>
