  <p>I'm going to say all this once, 'cause it's getting tiring.</p><p>And anyone who fails to present <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">facts</span></strong>&nbsp;to refute what I'm laying out and pops up on my <em>Facebook</em>&nbsp;page, on my comment area of this Ticker, or anywhere else that I have moderation privileges will find themselves facing this:</p><p><img src="http://legalhighproviders.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/banhammer_forecast1.gif?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I'm happy to entertain a debate. &nbsp;I'm <strong><em>very tired</em></strong>&nbsp;of people running scaremongering <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">crap</span></strong>&nbsp;without a scintilla of scientific evidence or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">facts</span></strong>&nbsp;behind their claims or thinly-veiled scaremongering.</p><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-26/fukushima-filter-shutdown-adds-to-tepco-water-management-woes.html" target="_blank">Let's start with this:</a></p><blockquote><p>Japan&rsquo;s government will lead &ldquo;emergency measures&rdquo; to tackle radioactive water spills at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, wresting control of the disaster recovery from the plant&rsquo;s heavily criticized operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)</p></blockquote><p>Yes, radioactive materials are all over that site. &nbsp;Yes, the water contains radioactive isotopes. &nbsp;Yes, this is bad.</p><p>Now let's quantify things.</p><p>First, the current risk of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">catastrophic</span></strong>&nbsp;release of material. &nbsp;I will define that for you -- a rapid, aerosol release of radioactive isotopes that is sufficient to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningfully</span></strong>&nbsp;increase the risk of health deterioration or death <strong><em>somewhere other than mainland Japan in the reasonably-immediate area of the reactors.</em></strong></p><p>There is one place such a risk can reasonably arise today: <strong>The spent fuel pools.</strong></p><p>There is bad news and good news in that regard. &nbsp;The bad news is that for all intents and purposes all of the fuel inventory in those pools is where it was at the time of the tsunami. &nbsp;Further, the damage done to the pools has not been repaired nor can it reasonably be in many cases; the pools will have to be emptied of spent fuel instead. &nbsp;That's bad because it's possible for the remaining integrity of the systems there to be lost.</p><p>Now the good news: <strong>The heat released from decay decreases at an exponential rate once the fuel is removed from the reactor and is not in active use.</strong>&nbsp; It has been <strong><em>two years</em></strong>, more or less, since the accident. &nbsp;A <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lot</span></strong>&nbsp;of the risk of a spent-fuel pool disaster has thus been taken off the table <strong><em>simply through the passage of time.</em></strong></p><p>I do not have an inventory of the pools and as far as I know there has been no public release of that inventory, including when each of the fuel bundles in there was removed from active service, how many of them are new ("unburned") fuel assemblies that were slated to be into active service, etc. &nbsp;<strong><em>All of this matters -- a lot -- to the risk profile involved.</em></strong></p><p>There are two risks with unloading the pools. &nbsp;First, it <strong><em>theoretically</em></strong>&nbsp;possible for a criticality event to take place in the pool during that operation. &nbsp;The pools and operating protocols normally preclude this, but the damage done during the accident means that the geometric protections built into the way the bundles are stored may or may not be entirely intact. &nbsp;We must assume that at least part of that protection is gone.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">However</span></strong>, even with that protection gone it is pretty hard to get an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accidental</span></strong>&nbsp;criticality, especially with spent fuel. &nbsp;It's not impossible by any means, but the reactivity of spent fuel is considerably lower than that of fresh fuel&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong>&nbsp;water is necessary as a moderator. &nbsp;So paradoxically a loss of cooling actually <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reduces</span></strong>&nbsp;(to effectively zero) the risk of such an event.</p><p>The final point on an accidental criticality event in the pools is that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span></strong>&nbsp;if happens it will leave <strong><em>exactly nothing</em></strong>&nbsp;to the imagination. &nbsp;There will not hiding it and no question if it occurs.&nbsp; This sort of incident, if it happens, will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">truly</span></strong>&nbsp;"ring the bell" in a way that cannot be hidden or "un-rung."</p><p>Now the bad news: a loss of cooling capacity in those pools, if it goes on long enough or is of a catastrophic sort, will cause the bundles to overheat, and if they are "fresh" enough they can still violate the cladding and potentially have what amounts to a decay-heat fed fire. &nbsp;That's the "really awful" scenario. &nbsp;And the paradox is that eventually those bundles have to be unloaded from the pools.</p><p>But -- and this is important -- time is our friend in this regard. &nbsp;The longer you keep them cool under water, the more of that decay heat is dissipated <strong><em>and the lower the risk of an overheat incident.</em></strong>&nbsp; Eventually you can remove them to air-cooled casks, which would be the ideal situation. &nbsp;The challenge is doing it without taking a lethal dose of radiation in the process; the water in the pool is a good radiation shield but you have to get the fuel into a cask (made of lead or similar that provides adequate shielding) without delivering lethal radiation to the people operating the equipment.</p><p>Of course this risk has to be balanced against the possibility of a second earthquake that topples the structures, which must be presumed to be materially weakened. &nbsp;<strong><em>That would be a true catastrophic event.</em></strong></p><p>Now on to the reactors and water leaks.</p><p>Nobody knows where the cores are in the reactors themselves that were operating at the time of the event. &nbsp;There are many who <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">claim</span></strong>&nbsp;that they have violated not only the reactor vessel <strong><em>but also the secondary containment </em></strong>and are literally in the earth. <em><strong>&nbsp;There is no evidence to back up this claim at the present time</strong></em>&nbsp;and if this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span></strong>&nbsp;happened and was leading to ridiculously high level releases of radioisotopes into groundwater <strong><em>where is the evidence of this in samples from both water on or near the site and surrounding sea?</em></strong></p><p>The inside of the pressure vessels (what's left of them anyway) is an unholy mess with radiation levels high enough that even robotics cannot survive for any material amount of time, so this presents a serious challenge of verification -- at least for now. &nbsp;And that makes the claims that this has happened impossible to scientifically refute <strong><em>except by exclusion</em></strong>&nbsp;since nobody can to take a picture and effectively "go look."&nbsp;</p><p>But exclusion is pretty-good science, and if in fact the cores were effectively eroding away en-masse into the groundwater <strong><em>there would be hard proof of this via isotopic analysis of the water in the vicinity.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So.... where is it?</p><p>Now let's look at the release of radioactive material that we <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span></strong>&nbsp;about -- <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/08/10/the-fukushima-radiation-leak-is-equal-to-76-million-bananas/" target="_blank">I'll quote <em>Forbes</em>:</a></p><blockquote><p>Tepco admitted on Friday that a cumulative 20 trillion to 40 trillion becquerels of radioactive tritium may have leaked into the sea since the disaster.</p></blockquote><p>Let's use the higher number. &nbsp;</p><p>40 trillion is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lot</span></strong>, right?</p><p>Well....</p><p>A "bequerel" is a <strong><em>very</em></strong>&nbsp;small unit of radiation. &nbsp;It is one decay event <strong><em>per second</em></strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>One.</p><p>To put this in some perspective a single <strong><em>ordinary banana</em></strong>&nbsp;has about 15 Bequerels of activity. &nbsp;That is, if you measured <strong><em>all</em></strong>&nbsp;of the breaking down (and naturally-occurring) potassium in said banana, you'd count 15 decays per second.</p><p>Hmmm... you say, that's a hell of a lot of bananas.</p><p>Ok, I'll give you that.</p><p>But there are a hell of a lot of bananas that grow (and are eaten!) every year.</p><p>If you remember, in <em>Leverage</em>&nbsp;(look to the right) I talk about using coal as a feedstock for a sustainable energy paradigm. &nbsp;I put forward this path because coal naturally contains a small amount of <em>Thorium</em>, which is fertile. &nbsp;It is also (mildly) radioactive and in fact is where most of the radioactivity that comes from coal plant emissions is found.</p><p>Now those emissions cause lung cancer. &nbsp;We know this but we tolerate it because we want our lights to come on when we flip the switch. &nbsp;So the question becomes <strong><em>exactly how much radiation do those plants emit into the atmosphere?</em></strong></p><p>There answer is about 0.1 <strong><em>Exa</em></strong>Bequerel, or 1 x 10^17 Bequerels <strong><em>each and every year.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Fukushima is releasing less than 1/1000th of that amount.</strong></p><p>Now that might sound like the end of the conversation, but it's not. &nbsp;See, not all radiation is equal. &nbsp;There are three rough categories and then one modifier when it comes to human exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>The three categories are the types of emission -- alpha, beta and gamma. &nbsp;</p><p>Alpha is the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most hazardous</span></strong>&nbsp;when inhaled or eaten. &nbsp;Alpha radiation is an atomic nucleus (of mass 4; it is a helium nucleus in atomic composition)&nbsp;<strong><em>and is stopped by a single piece of ordinary paper -- or intact skin (the outer layers of which are dead, by the way)</em></strong>, but because it's so large (comparatively) it has a high risk of damaging DNA in the body. &nbsp;As a result alpha emitters <strong><em>outside</em></strong>&nbsp;the body are almost completely harmless. &nbsp;<strong><em>Inside</em></strong>&nbsp;the body they are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;dangerous because the first thing they are likely to contact is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alive</span></strong> and they can and do cause cancer along with acute radiation poisoning (and death.) &nbsp;Thus, the risk from coal-fired power plants and their emissions when it comes to lung cancers.</p><p>Beta is next. &nbsp;It is less-hazardous as it is basically electrons (or positrons.) &nbsp;Electrons are smaller (by a lot!) than alpha particles and thus are less-likely to cause a mutation. &nbsp;Note that "less-likely" doesn't mean <strong><em>not dangerous</em></strong>, however. &nbsp;Beta can be shielded against with a thin piece of aluminum or similar material. &nbsp;Note that beta emissions are <strong><em>intentionally</em></strong>&nbsp;used in a medical PET scanner (positrons.)</p><p>Finally there is gamma radiation. &nbsp;Gamma can be emitted when a decay event happens and the nucleus is left in an excited and unstable state. It behaves like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation (e.g. radio, infrared, etc)&nbsp;<strong><em>except</em></strong>&nbsp;that it is of much higher energy and frequency, and thus shorter wavelength. &nbsp;It is <em>ionizing</em>&nbsp;radiation, meaning that it is capable of knocking electrons out of an atom's orbit and thus does direct damage to tissue. &nbsp;However, being a photon they do not have charge. &nbsp;Gamma is difficult to shield against because it is a photon and a <strong><em>wave</em></strong>&nbsp;as opposed to a <strong><em>particle</em></strong>; material thicknesses of lead, concrete or other dense materials (such as water) are required to provide material shielding against gamma.</p><p>Ok, now let's look at the spectrum of risk materials at Fukushima and focus on a couple of particular interest.</p><p>First is <em>Tritium</em>. &nbsp;Much has been made of the fact that there's a lot of it over there, and there is. &nbsp;Tritium decays by<em>&nbsp;beta</em>&nbsp;emission, which is moderately dangerous. &nbsp;(It is that emission, incidentally, that makes "tritium weapon sights" and similar things work in conjunction with a phosphor.) &nbsp;Tritium is "heavy hydrogen" and thus can from any compound that hydrogen can, including <strong><em>water</em></strong>. &nbsp;It is that water that many people are freaked out about. &nbsp;The beta decay that comes from it is relatively-low energy and while dangerous, is not <strong><em>especially</em></strong>&nbsp;hazardous.</p><p>But water is water, and biologically <em>Tritium</em>&nbsp;does not bioaccumulate for this reason. &nbsp;It has a half-life after exposure of one to two weeks, depending on the species that ingests (or swims in) it. &nbsp;This isn't great but it also isn't catastrophic, and dilution of course cuts exposure.</p><p>Tritium is <strong><em>naturally produced</em></strong>&nbsp;in all water-cooled reactors. &nbsp;It is also intentionally produced for use in nuclear weapons. &nbsp;</p><p>Leaving that aside in 2003 56 pressurized water reactors in the US released approximately 1.5 x 10^15 Bequerels of Tritium.</p><p>Look up above. &nbsp;Fukushima has released 40 x 10^12, or 4 x 10^13 Bequerels <strong><em>total</em></strong>&nbsp;since the accident, or (given 2 years) 2 x 10^13 annually.</p><p><strong>Approximately one hundred times as much Tritium was released to the environment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in one year</span>&nbsp;in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">normal operation</span>&nbsp;by US pressurized water reactors as has been released by Fukushima.</strong></p><p>Argue with the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">facts</span></strong>&nbsp;folks, because the <strong><em>facts</em></strong>&nbsp;are that while the radiation released is indeed a big number using <strong><em>Bequerels</em></strong>&nbsp;requires context as that's a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really tiny</span></strong>&nbsp;unit of radioactivity -- and as such it's really easy to scare people by using "big" Bequerel counts.</p><p>From this you might conclude that I am not concerned at all with this incident.</p><p><strong><em>Nothing could be further from the truth.</em></strong></p><p>Let's first start with the basics -- the <strong><em>scaremongering</em></strong>&nbsp;that "there is no such thing as a safe dose of radiation."</p><p>This may be technically true but it's also <strong><em>immaterial</em></strong>, because we're <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong>&nbsp;surrounded by radiation. &nbsp;I have a geiger counter on my desk. &nbsp;Right now it says the local background radiation is 0.150 uSv/hr. &nbsp;I can't get around this fact and neither can you, so the premise that "there is no such thing as a safe dose of radiation" is true <strong><em>but misleading</em></strong>&nbsp;because risk is non-linear <strong><em>and you can't avoid all radiation anyway.</em></strong></p><p>Dose of course is a matter of <strong><em>concentration</em></strong>. &nbsp;If you took that entire 2003 Tritium release you'd be <strong><em>very dead, very fast.</em></strong>&nbsp; You're not because it's spread all over the place and thus has an <strong><em>inconsequential</em></strong>&nbsp;impact on your total body radiation dose.</p><p>So how could Fukushima "get" you in terms of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span></strong>&nbsp;risk?</p><p>Two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>If there was a concentration point</strong>&nbsp;that "focused" that radiation such that you took it up in quantity. &nbsp;It is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;unlikely that anything like that is going to happen en-mass in terms of a release <strong><em>even in a nightmare scenario such as a spent fuel fire</em></strong>&nbsp;at Fukushima that would have a material impact on the United States. &nbsp;But in terms of ongoing release there is <strong><em>one</em></strong>&nbsp;element that poses a material risk of this happening (without such a catastrophe), and that's Strontium. &nbsp;The reason for that is that Strontium has a relatively long half-life (~29 years) and behaves in the body as does <strong><em>calcium</em></strong>, which means it accumulates in the bones. &nbsp;In sea life small fish are eaten by bigger fish, and so on until we eat the bigger fish. &nbsp;<strong><em>Strontium has the potential to bioaccumulate in fish and thus wind up in you.</em></strong>&nbsp; The good news is that you don't (usually) eat the bones, at least intentionally. &nbsp;The better news is that Strontium decays by beta emission and thus is pretty easy to detect (unlike an alpha emitter which is tougher to detect.) &nbsp;Now here's the gotcha: <strong><em>Nobody is reporting any material amount of accumulated Strontium in fish -- if it's there where are the scaremongers with geiger counters lighting up like christmas trees on top of pacific tuna? &nbsp;Missing, that's where.</em></strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></li><li><strong>If you're sitting on top of, or near, the reactors.</strong>&nbsp; If you're close to them then your risk of being dosed goes up -- a lot. &nbsp;If there is a further release incident <strong><em>that risk becomes very material</em></strong>&nbsp;(e.g. a spent fuel pool problem.) &nbsp;Therefore, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span></strong>&nbsp;you live in the general area of the crippled plant there's a materially-elevated risk that you will need to be mindful of for a very long time.</li></ul><p>Incidentally <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span></strong>&nbsp;claiming that there is an ongoing risk of radioactive Iodine release must be <strong><em>immediately</em></strong>&nbsp;challenged to show where active criticality <strong><em>is occuring now</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and if they're can't they're either ignorant and thus should be ignored or they know they're full of crap and are trying to scare you in some fashion</span></strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>The reason is that radioactive Iodine of interest (I-131)&nbsp;<strong><em>is only produced in an environment of active fission</em></strong>&nbsp;and has a half-life of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">eight days</span></strong>. &nbsp;After <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span></strong>&nbsp;half-lives there is effectively <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">none</span></strong>&nbsp;of whatever you started with left. &nbsp;This means that <strong><em>within three months after the accident</em></strong>&nbsp;it was all gone.</p><p>The bottom line is that there's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">zero</span></strong>&nbsp;evidence of &nbsp;contamination <strong><em>in amounts that are biologically relevant thus far</em></strong>, despite the repeated claims of those who would like it to be otherwise and are peddling "we're all gonna die" scaremongering nonsense.</p><p>If you claim that there <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></strong>&nbsp;such evidence then let's see you produce it. &nbsp;It should not be difficult because the elements in question (Cesium and Strontium) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span></strong>&nbsp;decay by beta emission (as does Tritium.)</p><p><strong>In short, let's see your evidence if you have the contrary point of view. &nbsp;What I see here over the last two years is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span>&nbsp;change in background radiation levels and I've also yet to find <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span>&nbsp;evidence of contamination in food that passes through this household.</strong></p>

Including the president.&rdquo;</p><p>...</p><p>When he was deputy Treasury secretary in 1998, Summers helped thwart an effort by Brooksley Born, then-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to consider regulating over-the-counter derivatives. That market ballooned to a notional value of almost $600 trillion in 2007 from about $28 trillion at the time of Born&rsquo;s proposal.

  <p><a href="http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2013/2013Hall.pdf" target="_blank">An utterly <em>fascinating</em>&nbsp;economic and banking paper</a> was presented at Jackson Hole this week by <em>The Hoover Institution</em>&nbsp;at Stanford. &nbsp;Like many such papers it is full of claims that revolve around mathematics, but one need not understand advanced math to obtain the gist -- and intent -- of the presenter.</p><p>The abstract reads:</p><blockquote><p>The United States and most other advanced countries are closing on five years of flat-out expansionary monetary policy that has failed in all cases to restore normal conditions of employment and output. These countries have been in liquidity traps,&nbsp;<strong>where monetary policies that normally expand the economy by enlarging the monetary&nbsp;base are ineffectual.</strong> Reserves have become near-perfect substitutes for government&nbsp;debt, so <strong>open-market policies of funding purchases of debt with reserves have essentially&nbsp;no effect.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Read: QE does nothing of value.</p><blockquote><p>The U.S. economy entered this state because a financial crisis originating in&nbsp;a financial system built largely on real-estate claims came close to collapse when the&nbsp;underlying assets lost value.</p></blockquote><p>Read:&nbsp;<strong>The underlying "value" never existed; it was a wide-scale fraud.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Rising risk premiums discouraged investments in plant,&nbsp;equipment, and new hiring. Weakened banks and declining collateral values depressed&nbsp;lending to households and forced their deleveraging.</p></blockquote><p>Read:&nbsp;<strong>The leverage was ill-advised and founded on nothing more than hot air; when discovered the lack of sustainability of the lending was exposed and the exponentially-built bubble burst.</strong></p><blockquote><p>The combination of low investment&nbsp;and low consumption resulted in an extraordinary decline in output demand, which&nbsp;called for a markedly negative real interest rate<em><strong>, one unattainable because the zero&nbsp;lower bound on the nominal interest rate coupled with low inflation put a lower bound&nbsp;on the real rate at only a slightly negative level.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Admitted:&nbsp;<em>The real rate of interest, which must always be&nbsp;<span>positive</span>&nbsp;in a stable economic environment such that borrowing to&nbsp;<span>produce</span>&nbsp;is incentivized rather than borrowing as a&nbsp;<span>ponzi scheme</span>&nbsp;as the intent is to&nbsp;<span>never</span>&nbsp;pay off the loan&nbsp;<span>but rather to roll it over at ever-decreasing rates of interest that are negative in real terms</span>,&nbsp;</em>has been the underlayment for the economy over the last&nbsp;<span>30 years</span></strong>.</p><p><a title=" by genesis" href="akcs-www?get_gallerynr=4247" target="_blank"><img src="akcs-www?get_gallery=4247" alt="" /></a></p><blockquote><p>As output demand recovers, the lower&nbsp;bound will cease to be an impediment and normal conditions will prevail again.</p></blockquote><p>Read:&nbsp;<strong>Wishful thinking.</strong></p><p>It's not often that you get an academic to admit that it has been&nbsp;<strong><span>policy</span></strong>&nbsp;to create asset bubbles and drive the spending of money which one not only doesn't have now&nbsp;<strong><em>but has no expectation of ever having in the future</em></strong>, relying instead of a&nbsp;<strong><span>permanently</span></strong>&nbsp;negative real rate of interest&nbsp;<strong><em>such that the cost of whatever it is that is being bought can be fraudulently shifted to society generally.</em></strong></p><p>This subsidy is&nbsp;<strong><span>not</span></strong>&nbsp;simply one employed by schools, local, state and federal governments where one can make an argument that it&nbsp;<strong><span>at least</span></strong>&nbsp;benefits everyone (since you get the road, school, library or fire station to enjoy.) &nbsp;<strong><em>No, it is employed by&nbsp;<span>everyone</span>&nbsp;in the economy when this condition exists, so a business can&nbsp;<span>force</span>&nbsp;you to pay for its "expansion" through this very same mechanism, robbing you just as effectively as if a gun was shoved up your nose.</em></strong></p><p>Mr. Hall, of course, doesn't talk about that, and with good reason -- Stanford might find itself with a bit of a problem among its students, say much less the general population, where it to be&nbsp;<strong><em>widely understood</em></strong>&nbsp;what is considered "normal" among its academics.</p><p>The other amusing piece of the paper comes right near the end where Mr. Hall says the following:</p><blockquote><p>So far, inflation has fallen only slightly and remains in positive territory. Fears in early 2009&nbsp;that rapid deflation might break out and cause the economy to collapse as in 1929 to 1933&nbsp;proved unfounded, luckily. I have advanced the hypothesis that rampant price-cutting has&nbsp;failed to appear because businesses are in equilibrium and perceive that price-cutting has&nbsp;bigger costs than benets. If the hypothesis is wrong and businesses are finally responding&nbsp;to five years of slack by cutting prices, the generally optimistic tone of this section could be&nbsp;quite mistaken. The bottom could fall out of the economy as it did in the Great Depression.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What?</strong></p><p>The solution to high prices is......&nbsp;<em>high prices.</em></p><p>Why? &nbsp;Because&nbsp;<strong><em>excess profits</em></strong>&nbsp;lead other competitors to enter the market, which in turn brings&nbsp;<strong><em>lower prices.</em></strong></p><p>Well, this happens in an "ordinary" economy anyway.</p><p>But what happens when you have a central bank, or a bunch of central banks, that are&nbsp;<strong><span>repressing</span></strong>&nbsp;the real rate of interest (remember, the central premise is that&nbsp;<strong><em>nobody ever intentionally lends -- or otherwise acts economically -- at a loss</em></strong>, so the only way this can happen is via&nbsp;<strong><span>intentional</span></strong>&nbsp;intervention by some actor with the ability to use force) in the economy?</p><p>Then you can&nbsp;<strong><span>prevent</span></strong>&nbsp;competitive forces from driving down the real cost of goods and services. &nbsp;But price-cutting is good, not bad. &nbsp;You want&nbsp;<strong><span>low</span></strong>&nbsp;prices, not high ones. &nbsp;<strong><em>In other words you, as a consumer, want&nbsp;<span>deflation</span>, not inflation!</em></strong></p><p>So for every WalMart and their "low prices" there must be an Exxon&nbsp;<strong><em>and their ramping prices</em></strong>, and to prevent the public from catching on to the scam that is being run we then must&nbsp;<strong><span>also</span></strong>&nbsp;do things like not count the increase in home prices as "inflation",&nbsp;<strong><em>instead using intentionally dishonest metrics like "owners equivalent rent", which is driven lower&nbsp;<span>as negative real rates of interest develop</span>&nbsp;since the cost of&nbsp;<span>financing</span>&nbsp;a house decreases with decreasing coupon&nbsp;<span>even as the price goes higher</span></em></strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately all machinations of this sort have an endpoint because all such attempts to repress wind up expressed as an&nbsp;<strong><span>exponential function</span></strong>. &nbsp;This is the nature of anything that is rolled over, or&nbsp;<strong><em>compounded</em></strong>, and no amount of mathematical arm-waving can change it.</p><p>Mr. Hall learned this in roughly the 7th or 8th grade, like the rest of us.</p><p>What he hopes is that you, and the rest of America, forgot it.</p><p>Good luck Mr. Hall.</p>

Let's first look at "alarming", shall we?</p><blockquote><p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,331 people were killed and 387,000 injured in 2011 in <strong>motor vehicle crashes implicating a distracted driver -- a category that includes texting, eating, grooming and using a navigation system, among other actions.</strong></p></blockquote><p>So what percentage of those were <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually</span></strong>&nbsp;texting?</p><blockquote><p>But texting is a triple threat, requiring a driver&rsquo;s mind, hands and eyes. In 2011, 11 percent of drivers ages 15 to 19 in fatal accidents were reported to have been distracted; for 21 percent of those, a phone was the culprit.</p></blockquote><p>Ah, an answer. &nbsp;11% of fatal accidents among those most-likely to be using a texting device (let's face it, kids do this more than older people) <strong><em>involved distracted driving</em></strong>&nbsp;rather than some other cause and of that 11% <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">21% were phone-related</span></strong>&nbsp;(note: <strong><em>still no breakout of texting as opposed to some other use of the phone, such as making a call without a hands-free device.</em></strong>)</p><p>So now we got numbers, even though they're over-represented. &nbsp;And they tell us that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.3%</span></strong>&nbsp;of fatal accidents among those <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most at risk</span></strong> (21% of 11%) <strong><em>involved the use of a cellphone in some form or fashion.</em></strong></p><blockquote><p><span>Herzog doesn't rely on statistics. He employs just one, at the film's beginning: "Over 100,000 accidents a year involve drivers who are texting.</span></p></blockquote><p>Ok, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">involved</span></strong>&nbsp;doesn't mean <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">caused</span></strong>. &nbsp;It just means <strong><em>involved</em></strong>.</p><p>Second, there are about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 million</span></strong>&nbsp;auto accidents a year. &nbsp;Roughly 2% of them involve someone who is distracted by a cellphone <strong><em>in some form or fashion</em></strong>&nbsp;at the time of the accident.</p><p>Oh, by the way, to put that 3,000-odd people killed annually in perspective, you're about as likely to drown (by accident) <strong><em>or choke on something other than your food. &nbsp;</em></strong>You're also about as likely to die due to a fire in a building (probably your house) and <strong><em>more likely</em></strong>&nbsp;to be accidentally poisioned by your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">medication</span></strong>.</p><p>So yeah, this is something to be concerned about, as death by preventable and accidental cause is something we should all be mindful of. &nbsp;I have smoke detectors in my house to try to mitigate the risk of dying in a household fire, I pay attention when around water (including my pool and the ocean) so I don't accidentally die in either and I don't stick things that I don't intend to eat in my mouth as a general rule to try to mitigate the risk of choking on them.</p><p>But to claim that this is some sort of "epidemic" or demands a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">legislative</span></strong>&nbsp;response is utter and complete horsecrap -- and I'm using <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">their</span></strong>&nbsp;numbers without challenge or attempt to validate them -- in other words, I accept that they may be (and probably are) <strong><em>intentionally</em></strong>&nbsp;overstating their case.</p>

  <p>Let's take a rather-jaundiced but honest look at Syria, shall we?</p><p>First, <strong><em>why does Syria matter</em></strong>? &nbsp;That's pretty simple -- they're a rather interesting energy <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">conduit</span></strong>&nbsp;from a strategic point of view. &nbsp;Syria also "owns" the Golan Heights, which is under Israeli occupation (Ed:&nbsp;<em>yes, I know Israel considers it to have been "annexed" -- the rest of the world sees it differently</em>.) &nbsp;Having part of your land occupied by a foreign power is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span></strong>&nbsp;good for your general civic mood, you see.</p><p>In addition Syria is an ally of both Iran and Russia, and the United States and Israel are concerned that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. &nbsp;They may be and they may not; the evidence is not clear. &nbsp;<strong><em>However</em></strong>, what is clear is that the uranium/plutonium fuel cycle is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">trivially</span></strong>&nbsp;exploitable to produce nuclear bombs, if you desire to do so. &nbsp;More on that in a bit.</p><p>Politically and culturally the nation is both Shiite and Sunni Muslim, with some Christian presence. &nbsp;There are also Kurds and Armenians in the nation from an ethnic perspective, none of which really like one another. &nbsp;The Assad regime, which is both dictatorial and brutal in its enforcement of "peace" (on its terms of course) has managed to more-or-less keep a pressure-cooker from exploding -- until recently.</p><p>The so-called "Arab Spring" is often blamed for the ignition of what is happening in Syria today. &nbsp;There is a decent case to be made that this was what emboldened people to rise, but the <strong>fact</strong>&nbsp;of the matter is that <strong><em>economic conditions along with state-initiated violence and dictatorship</em></strong>&nbsp;were the ingredients that led to civil war breaking out.</p><p>And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span></strong>&nbsp;are largely responsible for the economic conditions.</p><p>The United States, along with the rest of the "developed" western world, has for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">30 years</span></strong>&nbsp;run a policy of exporting our expansionary credit policy into other nations. &nbsp;That is, we have exported to them the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bad effects</span></strong>&nbsp;of this policy, which would otherwise have resulted in immediate and ruinous inflation, choking off the ability of our bankers and governments to run this scheme. &nbsp;Instead we foisted it off through our balance of trade <strong><em>and in particular our energy dependence on Middle East oil</em></strong>&nbsp;to other places in the world. &nbsp;China, India and the rest of the emerging markets got the "consumer goods" cost-push of our expansionary credit, while the Middle East got the oil side.</p><p>This has had the effect of impoverishing the people in these nations. &nbsp;China, for its part, tried to compensate by blowing its own credit bubble and building cities with no people in them. &nbsp;India, which has a large current account imbalance couldn't get away with that and now is suffering a massive collapse in their investment climate <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and currency</span></strong>, as their "miracle" of cheap labor for call centers and similar "enterprises" pops. &nbsp;</p><p>The Arab world managed to stave off what has been a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousand year</span></strong>&nbsp;conflict over religious differences with oil pumping and showering the trade imbalance dollars upon their people -- for some. &nbsp;That has also allowed the more-dictatorial regimes the funding necessary to repress opposition and maintain dictatorial rule -- after all, killing people may seem cheap but managing to keep the mass of the population from rioting and burning you out of your palace can be a bit more expensive.</p><p>The United States could have resolved most of this after WWII by going down an energy path that <strong><em>actually made sense</em></strong>, including the use of Thorium as a nuclear fuel. &nbsp;Had we done so, or <strong><em>if we were to do so today</em></strong>&nbsp;we would, within a decade, be <strong><em>entirely independent of outside energy resources and have a stable base of energy, both in liquid form (e.g. gasoline, diesel fuel and similar) and electricity for the next <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousand years</span></em></strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>But that path does not allow for the "side effect" of producing nuclear weapons from the same dual-use technology, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span></strong>&nbsp;would have exposed the full cost of producing and maintaining those weapons to the people, instead of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hiding</span></strong>&nbsp;a good part of it in both civilian nuclear power and naval propulsion.</p><p>In addition from the 1980s forward we discovered the "free" view of manipulating the economic cycle by encouraging credit expansion and then bailing out those who got too far over their skis. &nbsp;This has been going on for 30 years but in the last few it has reached its logical terminus and the "benign" appearance of these policies has been exposed as a fraud. &nbsp;Now "QE" and other "support" programs, instead of being soaked up by cheap energy exports from the Middle East, are translating <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span></strong>&nbsp;into out-of-control increases in the cost of living in those other nations.</p><p><strong>Empty stomachs, collapsing standards of living and rampant unemployment make for easily-incited populations.</strong></p><p>We have absolutely no business "intervening" in Syria. &nbsp;We also have absolutely no business arming Jihadists, <strong><em>but the evidence is that Barack Obama's administration has been doing exactly that. &nbsp;</em></strong>There is in fact a clean argument to be made that The United States government is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">itself</span>&nbsp;<em>a material supporter of Islamic Terrorism</em></strong>&nbsp;through the provision of both money and&nbsp;the provision of weapons to those who would <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and have</span></strong>&nbsp;used them against civilian populations in acts of&nbsp;<strong><em>terrorism</em></strong>&nbsp;(what else would you call burning a Christian church <em style="font-weight: bold;">with Christians inside?</em>)</p><p>The proper thing for us to do is to stop acting like jackasses and abusing our standing when it comes trying to swing the entire world around by the tail economically, force Bernanke to cut the crap and cease the lies about production, cost of living and credit inflation. &nbsp;In short, admit to this in public:</p><p><a title=" by genesis" href="akcs-www?get_gallerynr=4247" target="_blank"><img src="akcs-www?get_gallery=4247" alt="" /></a></p><p>That's not particularly likely, however -- at least not <strong>voluntarily</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's particularly true when you see the sort of academic stupidity that was on display at Jackson Hole this last week, which I will get to in a different <em>Ticker</em>. &nbsp;In short the premise of Central Bankers has been laid forth on the table for all to see -- <strong><em>they claim for themselves the fruits of technological advancement, rather than letting those who actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">earned it</span>&nbsp;keep it -- that would be you.</em></strong></p><p>It is indeed that very premise that keeps their schemes alive and anything that threatens it is to be opposed -- by violence if it becomes necessary.</p><p>Well, it's now "necessary" because the limits of doing it the other way (by persuasion in attempting to get people to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">voluntarily</span></strong>&nbsp;turn themselves into debt slaves) have been reached.</p><p>Obama and his ilk would be wise to stay out of this and instead plot a course that allows us to withdraw from that part of the world entirely -- economically, politically and socially -- leaving them to find their own way. &nbsp;They could do so through the same technologies we can exploit here, and become both energy independent without the need for oil exports as well as resolving much of their issue with fresh water, which is of course a huge problem in that part of the world.</p><p>Or, we can keep screwing around until one of the folks with nuclear weapons pokes one of the other ones in the balls, perhaps by accident and perhaps not, and we wind up with a rapidly-spreading war we cannot contain.</p><p>I prefer not to glow in the dark.</p><p>How about you?</p>

  <p>Oh do come on.</p><p>The Nasdaq is now claiming that <em>NYSE Arca</em>&nbsp;caused the Nasdaq "full stop" yesterday.</p><p>I don't buy it.</p><p>For those who were not paying attention (or got overwhelmed by the jargon) yesterday the Nasdaq unexpected went "dark" for close to three hours.</p><p>Let's dissect this.</p><p><strong><em>Some time before all of it became publicly known there was a problem</em></strong>&nbsp;I saw a number of option quotes <strong><em>inexplicably </em></strong>widen out to a ridiculous degree. &nbsp;I had no idea what was going on and at the time it just a few names; that sort of thing can happen due to rumors of news in a given stock, so <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">standing alone</span></strong>&nbsp;that didn't raise much in the way of alarms.</p><p>Then the quotes slowed to a trickle.</p><p>And then the halt, first only for "Tape C" names (Nasdaq) on their exchange <strong><em>and then at their request across all venues.</em></strong></p><p>We still don't know <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span></strong>&nbsp;what happened or why. &nbsp;Nasdaq this morning claims there was some sort of disruption coming from <em>NYSE Arca</em>, one of the other trading venues, that somehow managed to cause their systems to malfunction.</p><p>I have no idea if that's a legitimate explanation or not.</p><p>What I do know is that there have been plenty of odd things happening of late.</p><p>And I also know that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">yesterday</span></strong>, before the Nasdaq went dark, there were <strong><em>multiple</em></strong>&nbsp;instances of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;high quote volume and the option spreads on a number of names went nuts.</p><p><strong><em>As you're aware if you've been following a number of sources of market news, </em></strong>including myself and Nanex, there has long been a "tactic" of playing "<strong><em>feel the market up</em></strong>" among the HFT boys who issue <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousands</span></strong>&nbsp;or even <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tens of thousands</span></strong>&nbsp;of quotes for each trade that actually executes, which leads one to believe that the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">law</span>&nbsp;</strong>is being systematically broken.</p><p>What law is that? &nbsp;The Securities Act which says that any issuance of a bid or offer <strong><em>for any purpose other than to legitimately transact in the security in question</em></strong>&nbsp;is unlawful.</p><p>One would <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">expect</span></strong>&nbsp;that the <strong><em>exploitation</em></strong>&nbsp;of any dislocation one may cause by putting such an order into the system would be per-se proof of intent.</p><p>Well, one would expect that if we lived in a land where the Rule of Law meant something.</p><p>But we don't live in such a world.</p><p>Instead, we live in a world where anyone who can manage to exploit something -- effectively ripping someone else off -- it's just fine <strong><em>so long as you're rich, powerful or well-connected -- and it helps if you're all of the above and can in addition threaten to bring financial Armageddon on the world if you are not left alone.</em></strong></p><p>I don't know if we'll ever get to the bottom of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span></strong>&nbsp;what caused the dislocation yesterday.</p><p>But this much I do know -- there is no <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span></strong>&nbsp;marketplace in the securities business until and unless the HFT games end, and anyone who puts quotes on the wire without intent to execute is prosecuted for attempted manipulation.</p><p>The simple technological fix for this is to require that all quotes be valid until executed <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or for 2 seconds</span></strong>, whichever is less, and then additionally require that <strong><em>for each open quote the firm have the documented ability to clear the trade they propose to contract for by placing the quote.</em></strong></p><p>That would be (1) trivially easy to implement and (2) stop <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong>&nbsp;the games -- all at once.</p><p>That there is no intent to actually present a fair market to the public is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">proved</span></strong>&nbsp;by the refusal to promulgate such a requirement.</p>

  <p>Last night I had a <em>surreal</em>&nbsp;experience at the American Legion building in Ft. Walton.</p><p>If you live around here, you know where it is. &nbsp;There's a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tank</span></strong>&nbsp;out front.</p><p>It's a patriotic place.</p><p>Last night it hosted The Republican Club of Okaloosa County for their regular meeting, dinner and a speaker -- in this case, <em>Jeff Miller</em>&nbsp;(R-FL-1)</p><p>The food, hospitality, and crowd were a nice change from my usual evening routine (that often includes a nice hard run) but the surreal began when Mr. Miller stepped to the microphone.</p><p>What followed was an astonishing display of fear, cowardice and pandering. &nbsp;And this was before a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">friendly</span></strong>&nbsp;audience.</p><p>Mr. Miller proceeded in his talk and the Q&amp;A interspersed with it to lay forward at least two <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">clear</span></strong>&nbsp;cases in which there was little doubt he believed President Obama literally ignored the law, both dealing with Obamacare. &nbsp;He also left on the table several more examples in which one could reasonably conclude by his choice of words he believed this has taken place, including the IRS scandal and Benghazi.</p><p>Indeed, he lamented that we had "no idea" how hard it was for him to deal with people like Eric Holder <em>who he knows is lying to them on a daily basis.</em>&nbsp; (I remind you that when someone is in office part of their oath of office is to <em>faithfully discharge the laws</em>&nbsp;of the nation.) &nbsp;Yet his only "recourse", it appeared, was to make an argument that came dangerously close to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">begging</span></strong>&nbsp;that Republicans do nothing that <strong><em>might</em></strong>&nbsp;result in the loss of the House or impair the recpature of The Senate in 2014; indeed, <strong><em>he referenced what amounted to "fear" of such a "stumble", and repeatedly made reference to the horror of Obama being able to basically "do anything he wants" if that was to happen.</em></strong></p><p>With all due respect (none) <strong><em>how is that different than what is happening <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>&nbsp;if you are willing to allow a man to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentionally</span>&nbsp;thumb his nose at the law <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and do nothing about it</span>?</em></strong></p><p>Indeed, one of the questions from the audience <strong><em>actually referenced </em></strong>a "monarchy" in Washington and I sat <strong><em>slack-jawed</em></strong>&nbsp;as Mr. Miller not only acknowledged the questioner's view <strong><em>and did not challenge it</em></strong>&nbsp;but wove it into the "fear factor" that <strong><em>it would get worse</em></strong>&nbsp;unless people "trust him" and the "Republican establishment" (by, of course, electing more Republicans) -- and in the process he even dropped Hillary's name as the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">heir apparent</span></strong>&nbsp;(yes, he used those words.)</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heir apparent</span>?</strong></p><p>Finally turning to one of the questions which was more-or-less of the form "<em>what are you going to do about the lawless behavior of this administration?</em>" (incidentally, Mr. Miller, that was my question that you didn't take -- the last hand that went up wasn't a confederate of mine -- he just voiced what I wanted to ask you in public) Miller basically <strong><em>resigned his responsibility</em></strong>&nbsp;(but not his office, of course) and essentially folded his cards, citing Clinton's impeachment (but failed removal from office) as justification. &nbsp;Additionally, he had earlier but in the same context dismissed the premise of putting forward what the Republicans claim to stand for in the budget process and then tell the Senate to either vote it up and the President to sign it <strong><em>or shut the government down for lack of spending authority</em></strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly citing</span></strong>&nbsp;that he believed the people would "blame the Republicans" and playing to the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fear</span></strong>&nbsp;of many benefit recipients in the audience of the specter of checks not going out (obviously, Social Security and Medicare.)</p><p>None of this should really surprise anyone who has followed politics for the last many years. &nbsp;It's the same old song. &nbsp;</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>Remember that until 1999 Congress had authorized an "independent counsel" (otherwise called a <em>special prosecutor</em>) law that allowed the US Court of Appeals to name such a person. &nbsp;There are arguments that this power was abused by Congress on a repeated and wanton basis, and in 1999 the law lapsed, failing to be renewed.</p><p>Miller also cited the Supreme Court's upholding of the Affordable Care Act as constitutional and lamented that. &nbsp;<em>What he didn't discuss is that Roberts <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">explicitly</span></strong>&nbsp;put forward a rank violation of the Constitution in doing so, as by upholding the law as a tax rather than a broad (and unconstitutional) writ of mandamus to perform a given act <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Roberts gave the act standing as a direct but un-apportioned tax</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;which is prohibited by black-letter language in The Constitution itself.</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The particularly-galling part of that decision, as I have repeatedly commented on, is that the Congressional Record is clear on this point -- Congress <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>knew</strong></span>&nbsp;that attempting to define PPACA as a tax would be an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unconstitutional direct tax</span></strong>&nbsp;and as a result the law was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">explicitly written</span></strong>&nbsp;as an effective <em>writ of mandamus</em>&nbsp;instead -- despite the possibility of that being ruled unconstitutional.</p><p>But what remains inescapable is that The House retains the sole Constitutional authority of the purse.</p><p><strong><em>All bills that raise revenue (taxes) must originate in The House</em></strong>; without said bills the government has the authority to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do nothing</span></strong>, as it requires money to do essentially anything at a government level. &nbsp;</p><p>So here's the problem, in a nutshell -- <strong><em>we no longer have legislators -- or anyone else in political office -- who will put their necks on the line.</em></strong>&nbsp; The incentives to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>&nbsp;do so is strong -- it certainly appears that <strong><em>all 545 members of The House, Senate, US Supreme Court and Presidency</em></strong>&nbsp;along with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong>&nbsp;of their minions, political appointees and employees <strong>can effectively violate the law at will</strong>&nbsp;and nothing will happen to them <strong><em>until and unless the Attorney General wants to act</em></strong> -- and since he bears one of those <em><strong>magical lapel pins</strong></em>&nbsp;the answer on when he will want to do that is "<strong>Never.</strong>"</p><p>This <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></strong>&nbsp;monarchy folks -- it just has a <strong><em>lot</em></strong>&nbsp;of monarchs, all of which squabble with one another but none of which will step to curtail any of the other's power to behave lawlessly <strong><em>because in doing so they will lose <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their own</span> "magical lapel pin<strong>."</strong></em></strong></p><p>So much for our alleged "Constitutional Republic."</p><p>And let's remember that this illusory magic, which operates <strong><em>only so long as everyone "respects" it</em></strong>, has become the true coin of the realm; Clapper, for example, <strong><em>perjured himself</em></strong>&nbsp;before Congress, a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">crime</span></strong>, and yet there is no prosecution. &nbsp;Many others have outright ignored subpoenas from Congressional committees or have lied before Congress as well, with one of the more-famous being Bernanke's "<em>I will not monetize the debt</em>" -- just days before he commenced doing exactly that. &nbsp;The NSA, incidentally, not only has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">admitted</span></strong>&nbsp;to violating both the rights of the people <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and its very authorizing law</span></strong>&nbsp;(which prohibits <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></strong>&nbsp;action operating within the US against US citizens, as does the CIA's authorizing law) <a href="https://www.eff.org/foia/fisc-orders-illegal-government-sureveillance" target="_blank"><strong><em>but the very "check and balance" often cited by people on both sides, the FISC court, has issued <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least one ruling calling the NSA's actions unconstitutional</span></em></strong>.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Department of Justice, for its part, refuses to release that ruling, prompting a suit by the EFF.</p><p>Miller, I will remind everyone who was there (and those who were not) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">claimed</span></strong>&nbsp;that the FISC court's oversight was both appropriate <strong><em>and effective</em></strong>. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong>Bluntly, Miller lied -- but at least Miller's lie, unlike Clapper's and so many others, wasn't under oath. &nbsp;He just lied with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">straight face</span>&nbsp;to his constituents -- <em>and his alleged supporters.</em></strong></p><p>Perjury, need I remind you, is a crime. &nbsp;So is obstruction of justice. &nbsp;Unfortunately bare political lies such as those by Miller last night are not crimes and we, the people, continue to lap 'em up.</p><p>This is the same problem that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">infests</span></strong>&nbsp;our so-called "law-enforcement agencies" -- although there we occasionally have exceptions bubble to the surface, <a href="http://www.weartv.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/breaking-news-joseph-floyd-guilty-35251.shtml" target="_blank">as with the conviction of Major Floyd on racketeering charges</a>&nbsp;last night. &nbsp;Lies and even perjury and outright lawlessness <strong><em>is almost never</em></strong>&nbsp;punished when the "connected few" commit these acts.</p><p>Then there are the banks, who perjured themselves over 100,000 times in filing knowingly-false affidavits bearing "robosigned" signatures <strong><em>they knew were false</em></strong>; to this day the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">outcomes</span></strong>&nbsp;of those false pleadings, by and large, stand.</p><p>What this nation needs are people who understand that <strong>Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison and more </strong>all undertook acts to establish and enforce <strong><em>the rule of law</em></strong>&nbsp;for all -- including themselves -- and understood full well that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if they lost they would literally hang</span></strong>.</p><p>Some of them did hang anyway&nbsp;<strong><em>even though they ultimately won</em></strong>.</p><p>In other words what we need are patriots willing to risk all <strong><em>should it come to that</em></strong>&nbsp;in order to do the right thing -- restoration of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Rule of Law</span></strong>.</p><p><strong><em>We have none of those today in office, nor as far as I can tell are any of them seeking office.</em></strong></p><p>What there is today is a legislature that stokes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fear</span></strong>&nbsp;that the "other party" will get into power and once it does, "<em>just wait until you see the horrible things it will do.</em>"&nbsp;</p><p>But the horrible things are already happening. &nbsp;We have our 4th Amendment rights being ignored because someone has a magical lapel pin and they wave around a flag that says "<em>you might be a terrorist</em>" (never mind that the these same "magic lapel pin bearers" refuse to call one of the most-notorious <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actual terrorists</span></em></strong>&nbsp;since 9/11, Hasan, by that moniker) and the people lap it up. &nbsp;Two clowns decide to blow up the Boston Marathon <strong><em>and we not only unconstitutionally search damn near an entire town</em></strong>&nbsp;but then on top of it the government goon squad riddles the boat where one of them is hiding with bullets <strong><em>despite the fact that he's unarmed</em></strong>&nbsp;and has not fired upon them (it would be difficult to shoot at someone if you don't have a gun!) &nbsp;Yeah, this guy deserves to fry for his crimes and I'm reasonably confident he will, but that doesn't change the fact that he's entitled to due process of law first <strong><em>and that killing him would conveniently prevent the disclosure of what he knows -- including perhaps that he was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentionally or recklessly</span>&nbsp;overlooked by those who shouldn't have, much as was the case on 9/11</em></strong>.</p><p>Our 2nd Amendment rights are in tatters; the cynical view is that the possessors of those <em>magical lapel pins</em>&nbsp;are damned scared of the fact that with the Second Amendment <em>if the people get tired of a monarchy of 545 people they have a means of effective recourse since they're outnumbered by roughly 500,000:1.</em>&nbsp;I often wonder if that's the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span></strong>&nbsp;reason that everyone wants to talk about "compromise" when it comes to guns? &nbsp;<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/21/black-teen-who-murdered-australian-jogger-posted-racist-tweets/" target="_blank">It certainly isn't that three hoodlums might otherwise shoot an unarmed jogger <strong><em>in the back of the head</em></strong></a>; after all existing law says that you can't buy or possess a firearm unless you're 18 (and none of those three are) <strong><em>nor can you buy ammunition</em></strong>. &nbsp;Clearly "the law" was no deterrent to that hideous crime -- why would it be a deterrent to any other? &nbsp;<strong><em>No, the law is only obeyed by the law-abiding; ergo, the purpose of restrictions on the Second Amendment thus has to be to prevent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the law abiding</span>&nbsp;from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demanding</span>&nbsp;that the law actually be enforced on an equal basis without fear or favor.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong>There can be no other reason why <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span>&nbsp;is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span>&nbsp;debarred the peaceful keeping and bearing of essentially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span>&nbsp;item that falls into the category of "small arms."</strong></p><p>And while there are occasional "wins" for the good guys, such as the conviction of Major Floyd last night in Crestview, there are far too many bad guys who are still free, still ignoring the law, and frankly, given the odds of any of them <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span></strong>&nbsp;facing justice they seem to be well-justified in erecting the middle finger in our general direction -- <strong><em>or sniveling in cowardice at the microphone while drumming up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fear</span>&nbsp;among their audience of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even more lashes with the whip</span>&nbsp;should a "different" magical lapel-pin bearer replace them.</em></strong></p><p>These are not leaders, they are cowards.</p><p>That we permit people like this to enter our communities and speak before us, treating them not only with respect but regaling their presence, inviting them to speak behind a flag-frocked podium in a hall decorated with the stories of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span></strong>&nbsp;heroes who put <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">their lives</span></strong>&nbsp;on the line so our freedoms might be maintained rather than pelting them with rotten tomatoes and boos, tells me what I need to know about the state of American society and what we, the people, ultimately deserve.</p><p><em>Until and unless we change in what we will put up and in fact fund and promote, we have and continue to deserve exactly what we're getting from Washington.</em></p>

  <p>When this entire <strong><em>Foreclosurefraud</em></strong>&nbsp;nonsense got going, and I started digging through documents from various parties, one of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">striking</span></strong>&nbsp;findings I kept coming up with was that <strong><em>mortgages had not been timely transferred into the trusts that form the MBS in question</em></strong>.</p><p>REMIC law is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span></strong>&nbsp;clear and has no exceptions or exclusions -- you either get the actual documents into the trust <strong><em>on time</em></strong>&nbsp;or you can't do it at all. &nbsp;The reason is that these are pass-through instruments for tax purposes and <strong><em>widespread, indeed trivial </em></strong>fraud would be easy to commit <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span></strong>&nbsp;no such requirement was adhered to (you could substitute only "good" loans later on, you could stuff the trust with "bad" loans posthumeously to generate fake losses, etc.)</p><p>I had argued that given the apparent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">widespread</span></strong>&nbsp;failure to transfer mortgages into these trusts an attempt to later sue for foreclosure in the name of the trust (by the Servicer as a nominee or agent of the Trust, etc) was <strong><em>presumptively invalid</em></strong>&nbsp;because the alleged "owner" of the mortgage <strong><em>in fact was not the owner</em></strong>&nbsp;because they never took their ownership interest in a timely fashion <strong><em>and the law bars them from doing so at a later date.</em></strong></p><p>Well.....</p><blockquote><p>In this appeal, the borrower contends the trial court erred by sustaining defendants' demurrer as to all of his causes of action attacking the nonjudicial foreclosure. &ensp; We conclude that, although the borrower's allegations are somewhat confusing and may contain contradictions, he nonetheless has stated a wrongful foreclosure claim under the lenient standards applied to demurrers. <strong>&ensp; We conclude that a borrower may challenge the securitized trust's chain of ownership by alleging the attempts to transfer the deed of trust to the securitized trust (which was formed under New York law) occurred after the trust's closing date.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfers that violate the terms of the trust instrument are void under New York trust law</strong></span>,<strong> and borrowers have standing to challenge void assignments of their loans even though they are not a party to, or a third party beneficiary of, the assignment agreement.</strong></p><p>We therefore reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p></blockquote><p>Oh oh....</p><p>And why did they take this position? &nbsp;<strong><em>Right here, which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span>&nbsp;the reason that I argued originally that this was a potentially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fatal</span>&nbsp;defect in these trusts:</em></strong></p><blockquote><p>Despite the foregoing cases, we will join those courts that have read the New York statute literally. &ensp; We recognize that a literal reading and application of the statute may not always be appropriate because, in some contexts, a literal reading might defeat the statutory purpose by harming, rather than protecting, the beneficiaries of the trust. <strong>&ensp; In this case, however, we believe applying the statute to void the attempted transfer is justified because it protects the beneficiaries of the WaMu Securitized Trust from the potential adverse tax consequence of the trust losing its status as a REMIC trust under the Internal Revenue Code.</strong> Because the literal interpretation furthers the statutory purpose, we join the position stated by a New York court approximately two months ago: &thinsp;&ldquo;Under New York Trust Law, every sale, conveyance or other act of the trustee in contravention of the trust is void. &ensp; EPTL &sect;&ensp;7&ndash;2.4. Therefore, the acceptance of the note and mortgage by the trustee after the date the trust closed, would be void.&rdquo; &ensp;(Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

Hetzel and Samuel Schulhofer-Wohl, Senior Economists, Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Minneapolis, respectively</p><p><strong>Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet</strong><br />The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as the System open market operations during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on June 18-19, 2013. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.</p><p>In support of the Committee's longer-run planning for improvements in the implementation of monetary policy, the Desk report also included a briefing on the potential for establishing a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility as an additional tool for managing money market interest rates. The presentation suggested that such a facility would allow the Committee to offer an overnight, risk-free instrument directly to a relatively wide range of market participants, perhaps complementing the payment of interest on excess reserves held by banks and thereby improving the Committee's ability to keep short-term market rates at levels that it deems appropriate to achieve its macroeconomic objectives. The staff also identified several key issues that would require consideration in the design of such a facility, including the choice of the appropriate facility interest rate and possible additions to the range of eligible counterparties. In general, meeting participants indicated that they thought such a facility could prove helpful; they asked the staff to undertake further work to examine how it might operate and how it might affect short-term funding markets. A number of them emphasized that their interest in having the staff conduct additional research reflected an ongoing effort to improve the technical execution of policy and did not signal any change in the Committee's views about policy going forward.</p></blockquote><p>These are "minutes"? &nbsp;Yeah.... "a number" is some sort of concrete thing -- right? &nbsp;Well, no. &nbsp;But nevermind, we'll continue onward.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Staff Review of the Economic Situation</strong><br />The information reviewed for the July 30-31 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first half of the year. Private-sector employment increased further in June, but the unemployment rate was still elevated. Consumer price inflation slowed markedly in the second quarter, likely restrained in part by some transitory factors, <strong>but measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.</strong> The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its advance estimate for second-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP), along with revised data for earlier periods, during the second day of the FOMC meeting.<strong> The staff's assessment of economic activity and inflation in the first half of 2013, based on information available before the meeting began, was broadly consistent with the new information from the BEA.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Really? &nbsp;<strong>I have an expectation that I'm going to get butt-reamed by the government, </strong>and it's backed up by the facts thus far. &nbsp;Pick your metric, they've all sucked when it comes to consumer purchasing power net-net and <strong><em>nothing</em></strong>&nbsp;The Fed can do in expanding credit further can change <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></strong>&nbsp;of that.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact all they can do is make it (much!) worse.</p><blockquote><p>Private nonfarm employment rose at a solid pace in June, as in recent months, while total government employment decreased further. The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent in June, little changed from its level in the prior few months. The labor force participation rate rose slightly, as did the employment-to-population ratio. The rate of long-duration unemployment decreased somewhat, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved up; both of these measures remained relatively high. Forward-looking indicators of labor market activity in the near term were mixed: Although household expectations for the labor market situation generally improved and firms' hiring plans moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat over the intermeeting period, and measures of job openings and the rate of gross private-sector hiring were little changed.</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Absolutely none of this is good and none of the QE games have done <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a thing</span>&nbsp;to improve employment.</em></strong>&nbsp; Go ahead and argue for "moar" of it folks. &nbsp;Good luck.</p><blockquote><p>Manufacturing production expanded in June, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization edged up. Auto production and sales were near pre-recession levels, and automakers' schedules indicated that the rate of motor vehicle assemblies would continue at a similar pace in the coming months. Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were generally consistent with further modest gains in factory output in the near term.</p></blockquote><p>And with what will all this pulled-forward demand continue under? &nbsp;Oh that's a problem.</p><blockquote><p>Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased more slowly in the second quarter than in the first. However, some key factors that tend to support household spending were more positive in recent months; in particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose in July to its highest level since the onset of the recession.</p></blockquote><p><img alt="smiley" src="../smilies/rofl.gif"></p><p>Riiiiight. &nbsp;How do you square that against the employment:population ratio?</p><blockquote><p>Conditions in the housing sector generally improved further, as real expenditures for residential investment continued to expand briskly in the second quarter. However, construction activity was still at a low level, with demand restrained in part by tight credit standards for mortgage loans. Starts of new single-family homes were essentially flat in June, but the level of permit issuance was consistent with gains in construction in subsequent months. In the multifamily sector, where activity is more variable, starts and permits both decreased. Home prices continued to rise strongly through May, and sales of both new and existing homes increased, on balance, in May and June. The recent rise in mortgage rates did not yet appear to have had an adverse effect on housing activity.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, ok. &nbsp;How come I keep hearing rumblings of Hedge Funds trying like hell to get out of their house positions <strong><em>like madmen</em></strong>&nbsp;while keeping it <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong>&nbsp;quiet -- notice that there has been NO mention of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span></strong>&nbsp;in the mainstream media.</p><blockquote><p>Growth in real private investment in equipment and intellectual property products was greater in the second quarter than in the first quarter.<a title="footnote 2" href="http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20130731.htm#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;Nominal new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft continued to trend up in May and June and were running above the level of shipments. Other recent forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, were mixed and pointed to modest gains in business equipment spending in the near term. Real business expenditures for nonresidential construction increased in the second quarter after falling in the first quarter. Business inventories in most industries appeared to be broadly aligned with sales in recent months.</p><p>Real federal government purchases contracted less in the second quarter than in the first quarter as reductions in defense spending slowed. Real state and local government purchases were little changed in the second quarter; the payrolls of these governments expanded somewhat, but state and local construction expenditures continued to decrease.</p><p>The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May as exports fell slightly and imports rose. The decline in exports was led by a sizable drop in consumer goods, while most other categories of exports showed modest gains. Imports increased in a wide range of categories, with particular strength in oil, consumer goods, and automotive products.</p><p>Overall U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, were unchanged from the first quarter to the second and were about 1 percent higher than a year earlier. Consumer energy prices declined significantly in the second quarter, although retail gasoline prices, measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, moved up in June and July. The PCE price index for items excluding food and energy rose at a subdued rate in the second quarter and was around 1-1/4 percent higher than a year earlier. Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in June and July, as were longer-term inflation expectations, which remained within the narrow range seen in recent years. Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages and employee benefits remained modest.</p></blockquote><p><img alt="smiley" src="../smilies/rofl.gif"></p><p>Yeah, and none of these clowns have bought a damned thing at the grocery store -- or gas station -- in the last couple of months. &nbsp;</p><p>Right?</p><blockquote><p>Foreign economic growth appeared to remain subdued in comparison with longer-run trends. Nonetheless, there were some signs of improvement in the advanced foreign economies. Production and business confidence turned up in Japan, real GDP growth picked up to a moderate pace in the second quarter in the United Kingdom, and recent indicators suggested that the euro-area recession might be nearing an end. In contrast, Chinese real GDP growth moderated in the first half of this year compared with 2012, and indicators for other emerging market economies (EMEs) also pointed to less-robust growth. Foreign inflation generally remained well contained. Monetary policy stayed highly accommodative in the advanced foreign economies, but some EME central banks tightened policy in reaction to capital outflows and to concerns about inflationary pressures from currency depreciation.</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Subdued?!</em></strong></p><p>Emerging equity markets are basically <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">crashing</span></strong>. &nbsp;Pick one; they all suck.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Staff Review of the Financial Situation</strong><br />Financial markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period as investors reacted to Federal Reserve communications and to incoming economic data and as market dynamics appeared to amplify some asset price moves. Broad equity price indexes ended the period higher, and longer-term interest rates rose significantly. Sizable increases in rates occurred following the June FOMC meeting, as investors reportedly saw Committee communications as suggesting a less accommodative stance of monetary policy than had been expected going forward; however, a portion of the increases was reversed as subsequent policy communications lowered these concerns. U.S. economic data, particularly the June employment report, also contributed to the rise in yields over the period.</p><p>On balance, yields on intermediate- and longer-term Treasury securities rose about 30 to 45 basis points since the June FOMC meeting, with staff models attributing most of the increase to a rise in term premiums and the remainder to an upward revision in the expected path of short-term rates. The federal funds rate path implied by financial market quotes steepened slightly, on net, but the results from the Desk's July survey of primary dealers showed little change in dealers' views of the most likely timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target. Market-based measures of inflation compensation were about unchanged.</p></blockquote><p>Uh huh. &nbsp;So distorting all of the bond market is just fine and has no impact on anything -- right?</p><p><img alt="smiley" src="../smilies/rofl2.gif"></p><blockquote><p>Over the period, rates on primary mortgages and yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose about in line with the 10-year Treasury yield. The option-adjusted spread for production-coupon MBS widened somewhat, possibly reflecting a downward revision in investors' expectations for Federal Reserve MBS purchases, an increase in uncertainty about longer-term interest rates, and convexity-related MBS selling.</p><p>Spreads between yields on 10-year nonfinancial corporate bonds and yields on Treasury securities narrowed somewhat on net. Early in the period, yields on corporate bonds increased, and bond mutual funds and bond exchange-traded funds experienced large net redemptions in June; the rate of redemptions then slowed in July.</p><p>Market sentiment toward large domestic banking organizations appeared to improve somewhat over the intermeeting period, as the largest banks reported second-quarter earnings that were above analysts' expectations. Stock prices of large domestic banks outperformed broader equity indexes, and credit default swap spreads for the largest bank holding companies moved about in line with trends in broad credit indexes.</p></blockquote><p>Restated: <strong><em>Earnings sucked</em></strong>&nbsp;ex-financials. &nbsp;Go ahead and argue this doesn't matter if you'd like; financials are an effective <strong><em>tax</em></strong>&nbsp;on the real economy, and the rotational games benefit them but kill everyone else.</p><p>Well?</p><blockquote><p>Municipal bond yields rose sharply over the intermeeting period, increasing somewhat more than yields on Treasury securities. In June, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained solid and was split roughly evenly between refunding and new-capital issuance. The City of Detroit's bankruptcy filing reportedly had only a limited effect on the market for municipal securities as it had been widely anticipated by market participants.</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Only limited? <img alt="smiley" src="../smilies/rofl2.gif"></em></strong></p><p>Anyone look at the Detroit School bond offering?</p><blockquote><p>Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses showed mixed changes. Reflecting the reduced incentive to refinance as longer-term interest rates rose, the pace of gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds dropped in June and July, compared with the elevated pace earlier this year. In contrast, gross issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms maintained its recent strength in June. Leveraged loan issuance also continued to be strong amid demand for floating-rate instruments by investors. Financing conditions for commercial real estate continued to recover slowly. In response to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks generally indicated that they had eased standards on both commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) and commercial real estate loans over the past three months. For C&amp;I loans, standards were currently reported to be somewhat easy compared with longer-term norms, while for commercial real estate loans, standards remained somewhat tighter than longer-term norms. Banks reported somewhat stronger demand for most types of loans.</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Somewhat easy? &nbsp;</em></strong>So all that PIK/Toggle crap and covenant-light (or absent) issuance is "somewhat" easy? &nbsp;This is beyond laughable; it's into the realm of outright <img alt="smiley" src="../smilies-local/bullcrap.gif"></p><blockquote><p>Financing conditions in the household sector improved further in recent months. Mortgage purchase applications declined modestly through July even as refinancing applications fell off sharply with the rise in mortgage rates. The outstanding amounts of student and auto loans continued to expand at a robust pace in May. Credit card debt remained about flat on a year-over-year basis. In the July SLOOS, banks reported that they had eased standards on most categories of loans to households in the second quarter, but that standards on all types of mortgages, and especially on subprime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, remained tight when judged against longer-run norms.</p></blockquote><p>You mean compared against the 2005 "fog-a-mirror" period? &nbsp;That's "longer-run" norms -- right Ben?</p><blockquote><p>Increases in total bank credit slowed in the second quarter, as the book value of securities holdings fell slightly and C&amp;I loan balances at large banks increased only modestly in April and May. M2 grew at an annual rate of about 7 percent in June and July, supported by flows into liquid deposits and retail money market funds. Both of these components of M2 may have been boosted recently by the sizable redemptions from bond mutual funds. The monetary base continued to expand rapidly in June and July, driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve's asset purchases.</p></blockquote><p>In other words The Fed continues apace to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">destroy</span></strong>&nbsp;7% of your purchasing power every year.</p><blockquote><p>Ten-year sovereign yields in the United Kingdom and Germany rose with U.S. yields early in the intermeeting period but fell back somewhat after statements by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England were both interpreted by market participants as signaling that their policy rates would be kept low for a considerable time. On net, the U.K. 10-year sovereign yield increased, though by less than the comparable yield in the United States, while the yield on German bunds was little changed. Peripheral euro-area sovereign spreads over German bunds were also little changed on net. Japanese government bond yields were relatively stable over the period, after experiencing substantial volatility in May. The staff's broad nominal dollar index moved up as the dollar appreciated against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies, consistent with the larger increase in U.S. interest rates. The dollar was mixed against the EME currencies. Foreign equity prices generally increased, although equity prices in China declined amid investor concerns regarding further signs that the economy was slowing and over volatility in Chinese interbank funding markets. Outflows from EME equity and bond funds, which had been particularly rapid in June, moderated in July.</p><p><strong>Staff Economic Outlook</strong><br />The data received since the forecast was prepared for the previous FOMC meeting suggested that real GDP growth was weaker, on net, in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.<a title="footnote 3" href="http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20130731.htm#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;Nevertheless, the staff still expected that real GDP would accelerate in the second half of the year. Part of this projected increase in the rate of real GDP growth reflected the staff's expectation that the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy would be smaller in the second half as the pace of reductions in federal government purchases slowed and as the restraint on growth in consumer spending stemming from the higher taxes put in place at the beginning of the year diminished. For the year as a whole, the staff anticipated that the rate of growth of real GDP would only slightly exceed that of potential output. The staff's projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was essentially unrevised, as higher equity prices were seen as offsetting the restrictive effects of the increase in longer-term interest rates. The staff continued to forecast that the rate of real GDP growth would strengthen in 2014 and 2015, supported by a further easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business confidence, additional improvements in credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy. The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually.</p></blockquote><p>Uh huh. &nbsp;How many of these "participants" predicted the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bad</span></strong>&nbsp;GDP reports against expectations? &nbsp;<strong><em>What is zero, Alex?</em></strong>&nbsp; And if your "projections" are that accurate why should anyone bother with any of your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">other</span></strong>&nbsp;projections?</p><blockquote><p>The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting. The staff continued to judge that much of the recent softness in consumer price inflation would be transitory and that inflation would pick up somewhat in the second half of this year. With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015.</p></blockquote><p>Of course it will be "stable." &nbsp;I'm very sure I'll get screwed -- that's stable I guess.</p><blockquote><p>The staff continued to see numerous risks around the forecast. Among the downside risks for economic activity were the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy, the possibility of adverse developments in foreign economies, and concerns about the ability of the U.S. economy to weather potential future adverse shocks. The most salient risk for the inflation outlook was that the recent softness in inflation would not abate as anticipated.</p><p><strong>Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook</strong><br />In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants noted that incoming information on economic activity was mixed. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, and the housing sector was strengthening. Private domestic final demand continued to increase in the face of tighter federal fiscal policy this year, but several participants pointed to evidence suggesting that fiscal policy had restrained spending in the first half of the year more than they previously thought. Perhaps partly for that reason, a number of participants indicated that growth in economic activity during the first half of this year was somewhat below their earlier expectations. In addition, subpar economic activity abroad was a negative factor for export growth. Conditions in the labor market improved further as private payrolls rose at a solid pace in June, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective.</p><p>Participants generally continued to anticipate that the growth of real GDP would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further thereafter. Factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic activity included highly accommodative monetary policy, improving credit availability, receding effects of fiscal restraint, continued strength in housing and auto sales, and improvements in household and business balance sheets. A number of participants indicated, however, that they were somewhat less confident about a near-term pickup in economic growth than they had been in June; factors cited in this regard included recent increases in mortgage rates, higher oil prices, slow growth in key U.S. export markets, and the possibility that fiscal restraint might not lessen.</p><p>Consumer spending continued to advance, but spending on items other than motor vehicles was relatively soft. Recent high readings on consumer confidence and boosts to household wealth from increased equity and real estate prices suggested that consumer spending would gather momentum in the second half of the year. However, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households' scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past.</p><p>The housing sector continued to pick up, as indicated by increases in house prices, low inventories of homes for sale, and strong demand for construction. While recent mortgage rate increases might serve to restrain housing activity, several participants expressed confidence that the housing recovery would be resilient in the face of the higher rates, variously citing pent-up housing demand, banks' increasing willingness to make mortgage loans, strong consumer confidence, still-low real interest rates, and expectations of continuing rises in house prices. Nonetheless, refinancing activity was down sharply, and the incoming data would need to be watched carefully for signs of a greater-than-anticipated effect of higher mortgage rates on housing activity more broadly.</p><p>In the business sector, the outlook still appeared to be mixed. Manufacturing activity was reported to have picked up in a number of Districts, and activity in the energy sector remained at a high level. Although a step-up in business investment was likely to be a necessary element of the projected pickup in economic growth, reports from businesses ranged from those contacts who expressed heightened optimism to those who suggested that little acceleration was likely in the second half of the year.</p><p>Participants reported further signs that the tightening in federal fiscal policy restrained economic activity in the first half of the year: Cuts in government purchases and grants reportedly had been a factor contributing to slower growth in sales and equipment orders in some parts of the country, and consumer spending seemed to have been held back by tax increases. Moreover, uncertainty about the effects of the federal spending sequestration and related furloughs clouded the outlook. It was noted, however, that fiscal restriction by state and local governments seemed to be easing.</p><p>The June employment report showed continued solid gains in payrolls. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and the continuing low readings on the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, together with a high incidence of workers being employed part time for economic reasons, were generally seen as indicating that overall labor market conditions remained weak. It was noted that employment growth had been stronger than would have been expected given the recent pace of output growth, reflecting weak gains in productivity. Some participants pointed out that once productivity growth picked up, faster economic growth would be required to support further increases in employment along the lines seen of late. However, one participant thought that sluggish productivity performance was likely to persist, implying that the recent pace of output growth would be sufficient to maintain employment gains near current rates.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, they were great employment numbers -- something like 3/4 of those "jobs" were McJobs -- part time, zero benefit, and/or both.</p><blockquote><p>Recent readings on inflation were below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, in part reflecting transitory factors, and participants expressed a range of views about how soon inflation would return to 2 percent. A few participants, who felt that the recent low inflation rates were unlikely to persist or that the low PCE inflation readings might be marked up in future data revisions, suggested that, as transitory factors receded and the pace of recovery improved, inflation could be expected to return to 2 percent reasonably quickly. A number of others, however, viewed the low inflation readings as largely reflecting persistently deficient aggregate demand, implying that inflation could remain below 2 percent for a protracted period and further supporting the case for highly accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>Both domestic and foreign asset markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period, reacting to policy communications and data releases. In discussing the increases in U.S. longer-term interest rates that occurred in the wake of the June FOMC meeting and the associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation. A few participants suggested that this shift occurred in part because Committee participants' economic projections, released following the June meeting, generally showed a somewhat more favorable outlook than those of private forecasters, or because the June policy statement and press conference were seen as indicating relatively little concern about inflation readings, which had been low and declining. Moreover, investors may have perceived that Committee communications about the possibility of slowing the pace of asset purchases also implied a higher probability of an earlier firming of the federal funds rate. Subsequent Federal Reserve communications, which emphasized that decisions about the two policy tools were distinct and underscored that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable period after purchases are completed, were seen as having helped clarify the Committee's policy strategy. A number of participants mentioned that, by the end of the intermeeting period, market expectations of the future course of monetary policy, both with regard to asset purchases and with regard to the path of the federal funds rate, appeared well aligned with their own expectations. Nonetheless, some participants felt that, as a result of recent financial market developments, overall financial market conditions had tightened significantly, importantly reflecting larger term premiums, and they expressed concern that the higher level of longer-term interest rates could be a significant factor holding back spending and economic growth. Several others, however, judged that the rise in rates was likely to exert relatively little restraint, or that the increase in equity prices and easing in bank lending standards would largely offset the effects of the rise in longer-term interest rates. Some participants also stated that financial developments during the intermeeting period might have helped put the financial system on a more sustainable footing, insofar as those developments were associated with an unwinding of unsustainable speculative positions or an increase in term premiums from extraordinarily low levels.</p></blockquote><p><img alt="smiley" src="../smilies/rofl.gif"></p><p><strong>MOAR CRACK FOR THE PIPE PLEASE!</strong></p><blockquote><p>In looking ahead, meeting participants commented on several considerations pertaining to the course of monetary policy. First, almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the characterization of the contingent outlook for asset purchases that was presented in the June postmeeting press conference and in the July monetary policy testimony. Under that outlook, if economic conditions improved broadly as expected, the Committee would moderate the pace of its securities purchases later this year. And if economic conditions continued to develop broadly as anticipated, the Committee would reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps and conclude the purchase program around the middle of 2014. At that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective. While participants viewed the future path of purchases as contingent on economic and financial developments, one participant indicated discomfort with the contingent plan on the grounds that the references to specific dates could be misinterpreted by the public as suggesting that the purchase program would be wound down on a more-or-less preset schedule rather than in a manner dependent on the state of the economy. Generally, however, participants were satisfied that investors had come to understand the data-dependent nature of the Committee's thinking about asset purchases. A few participants, while comfortable with the plan, stressed the need to avoid putting too much emphasis on the 7 percent value for the unemployment rate, which they saw only as illustrative of conditions that could obtain at the time when the asset purchases are completed.</p><p>Second, participants considered whether it would be desirable to include in the Committee's policy statement additional information regarding the Committee's contingent outlook for asset purchases. Most participants saw the provision of such information, which would reaffirm the contingent outlook presented following the June meeting, as potentially useful; however, many also saw possible difficulties, such as the challenge of conveying the desired information succinctly and with adequate nuance, and the associated risk of again raising uncertainty about the Committee's policy intentions. A few participants saw other forms of communication as better suited for this purpose. Several participants favored including such additional information in the policy statement to be released following the current meeting; several others indicated that providing such information would be most useful when the time came for the Committee to begin reducing the pace of its securities purchases, reasoning that earlier inclusion might trigger an unintended tightening of financial conditions.</p><p>Finally, the potential for clarifying or strengthening the Committee's forward guidance for the federal funds rate was discussed. In general, there was support for maintaining the current numerical thresholds in the forward guidance. A few participants expressed concern that a decision to lower the unemployment threshold could potentially lead the public to view the unemployment threshold as a policy variable that could not only be moved down but also up, thereby calling into question the credibility of the thresholds and undermining their effectiveness. Nonetheless, several participants were willing to contemplate lowering the unemployment threshold if additional accommodation were to become necessary or if the Committee wanted to adjust the mix of policy tools used to provide the appropriate level of accommodation. A number of participants also remarked on the possible usefulness of providing additional information on the Committee's intentions regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate after the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold was reached, in order to strengthen or clarify the Committee's forward guidance. One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment; another indicated that the Committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon. The latter enhancement to the forward guidance might be seen as reinforcing the message that the Committee was willing to defend its longer-term inflation goal from below as well as from above.</p></blockquote><p>If we like the (cooked) numbers we will taper. &nbsp;Or we won't. &nbsp;Or we will. &nbsp;But we won't tell you until we do. &nbsp;Or we don't. &nbsp;And we're really comfortable with what we think. &nbsp;Or we aren't.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2007 anyone</span></strong>?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Committee Policy Action</strong><br />Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year. Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen somewhat and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth. The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. With economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall. Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longer-run inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term. Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance.</p><p>In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. In considering the likely path for the Committee's asset purchases, members discussed the degree of improvement in the labor market outlook since the purchase program began last fall. The unemployment rate had declined considerably since then, and recent gains in payroll employment had been solid. However, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low. While a range of views were expressed regarding the cumulative improvement in the labor market since last fall, almost all Committee members agreed that a change in the purchase program was not yet appropriate. However, in the view of the one member who dissented from the policy statement, the improvement in the labor market was an important reason for calling for a more explicit statement from the Committee that asset purchases would be reduced in the near future. A few members emphasized the importance of being patient and evaluating additional information on the economy before deciding on any changes to the pace of asset purchases. At the same time, a few others pointed to the contingent plan that had been articulated on behalf of the Committee the previous month, and suggested that it might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as outlined in that plan. At the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee decided to continue adding policy accommodation by purchasing additional MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and to maintain its existing reinvestment policies. In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.</p><p>Members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting. In addition to updating its description of the state of the economy, the Committee decided to underline its concern about recent shortfalls of inflation from its longer-run goal by including in the statement an indication that it recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, while also noting that it continues to anticipate that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The Committee also considered whether to add more information concerning the contingent outlook for asset purchases to the policy statement, but judged that doing so might prompt an unwarranted shift in market expectations regarding asset purchases. The Committee decided to indicate in the statement that it "reaffirmed its view"--rather than simply "expects"--that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.</p><p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:</p><p>"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."</p><p>The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:</p><p>"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.
