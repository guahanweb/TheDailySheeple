<p>The Treasury Department and managers of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) are scrambling to figure out why homeowners who used the government&#8217;s bailout mechanism to save their homes are re-defaulting on their payments.</p>
<p>The program, originally designed to assist homeowners who were facing foreclosure following the 2007 sub-prime crisis, has reportedly saved 1.2 million people from losing their homes, but a <a href="http://www.housingwire.com/news/2013/07/23/sigtarp-searches-hamp-redefault-fix" target="_blank">report from the Special Inspector General</a> who oversees the government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) says that the loan modifications that were supposed to get American families back on their feet aren&#8217;t working as well as expected.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We launched this program in response to the worst housing crisis since the great depression,&#8221; Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad said in a press call.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will always be an inherent risk of homeowner default in programs like this,&#8221; Massad added.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of<strong> homeowners with an active HAMP permanent modification</strong> — a total of 88,000 out of 865,100— <strong>have missed one or two monthly mortgage payments and are at risk of redefaulting</strong> out of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Redefault rates of the oldest 2009 HAMP permanent mortgage modifications have continued to increase as they age and have reached <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a 46% redefault rate</span></strong>. The 2010 HAMP permanent mortgage modifications are redefaulting at a rate of 38%.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Treasury department is going to launch an <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/24/real_estate/hamp-default/index.html" target="_blank">investigation into why</a> the program isn&#8217;t working.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only has the program fallen far short of that goal but with each year of the program, a growing number of homeowners have re-defaulted, the inspector general found.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Treasury needs to research why so many borrowers are dropping out of the program</strong>,&#8221; said Christy Romero, the head of SIGTARP.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2009, as President Obama assured the nation that his multi-billion dollar economic bailouts would restore the economy and the housing market to stability and growth, we noted that you can modify these mortgages all you want, but that <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/jobs-will-not-return-until-2017_10212009" target="_blank">one important factor would be essential</a> to their success.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Unemployment is a ticking time bomb, and no mortgage modification is going to help if the home owner lost his or her income stream.</strong> Real estate will continue to collapse because of continued job destruction despite what we are being told about recovery. Couple this with rising costs for essential goods, a collapse in retail consumer lending and increased taxes, and I’d say hopes of recovery are just that… hopes.</p>
<p>For those who live in reality, it’s obvious that the American people are living in the Greatest Depression.</p>
<p><em>Via SHTFplan (<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/jobs-will-not-return-until-2017_10212009" target="_blank">October 21, 2009</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take a Nobel Prize winning Keynesian economist like Paul Krugmann to see this one coming. It only takes a working knowledge of basic arithmetic.</p>
<p>If your mortgage payment is $1500 monthly, and you just lost your job and are collecting $800 in unemployment insurance monthly, then it is impossible for you to make good on your loan. Even if the government helps to reduce your mortgage payment to $850 monthly and provides you with emergency funds to cover all of your other expenses like food, health insurance and utilities, you still can&#8217;t service your debt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>The situation for America is dire.</p>
<p>According to the June 2013 jobs report, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/05/only-47-americans-have-full-time-job" target="_blank">less than half</a> of able-bodied Americans have a full time job.</p>
<p>The following report further illustrates the problem(s) we face.</p>
<p><strong>Two food stamp recipients have been added for every job &#8216;created&#8217; under President Obama&#8217;s watch:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Since February of 2009, the first full month of Obama’s presidency, 9.5 million Americans have dropped out of the labor force.  <strong>Nearly 90 million Americans are <i>not</i> working today!</strong></p>
<p>That means that 1.3 Americans have dropped out of the labor force for every one job the administration claims to have created.</p>
<p><strong>There are 15 million <i>more</i> Americans on food stamps today than when Obama assumed office.</strong></p>
<p>At the end of January 2009, 32,204,859 Americans received aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. As of April 2013, there were 47,548,694 Americans on food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>That means that more than two Americans have been added to the food stamp rolls for every one job the administration says it has created.</strong></p>

<p>There is no recovery.</p>
<p>There will be no recovery any time soon.</p>
<p>Despite the rhetoric out of Washington, the Fed and mainline financial pundits, this economy is <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/bernanke-confirms-if-we-were-to-tighten-policy-the-economy-would-tank_07182013" target="_blank">on the brink of complete disaster</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Thursday <strong>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey</strong> told a Senate committee that the Obama administration is considering the use of military force in Syria.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Gen. Dempsey warned &#8220;the decision to use force is &#8230; no less than an act of war,&#8221; adding that the U.S. &#8220;must anticipate and be prepared for the unintended consequences of our action. &#8230; Deeper involvement is hard to avoid.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Before going over the options, Dempsey reiterated his non-committal stance: &#8221;The <strong>decision over whether to introduce military force is a political one that our Nation entrusts to its civilian leaders.</strong> I also understand that you deserve my best military advice on how military force could be used in order to decide whether it should be used.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: We&#8217;re looking at another long-term quagmire similar to Afghanistan and Iraq, <strong>or worse</strong>.</p>
<p>This will not be merely sorties being flown over Syria. It will involve large-scale troop movements. We know this as evidenced by the statements of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not the only ones <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/pentagon-blackout-large-american-military-force-deployed-to-syrian-border_06052013" target="_blank">putting boots on the ground</a>. Last week <a href="http://www.infowars.com/russia-amasses-full-combat-readiness-strategic-bombers/" target="_blank">Russia staged massive full combat readiness exercises</a> involving some 160,000 troops, naval ships, fighter planes and strategic bombers in preparation for the possibility of a U.S. led attack on Syria, and just a few weeks ago it was announced that the Syrians have been <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/russiasyria-will-be-armed-with-weapons-that-have-never-been-seen-before-in-the-middle-east_06212013" target="_blank">armed with weapons never before seen</a> in the middle east.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin may have sat on the sidelines while the United States took control of other mid east nations over the last decade, but all indications suggest he won&#8217;t be sitting idly by should the United States go to war in Syria.</p>
<p>It would not be an overreaction to suggest that a military engagement in Syria could engulf the U.S. and Russia in World War III, something that numerous analysts and contrarian thinkers have suggested would be the end result of our current global economic and political tensions.</p>
<blockquote><p>World War III will occur in the next five years. That means the Middle East will blow up. New regimes there will be less Western-friendly. The West has also figured out it can’t contain China, which is rising rapidly and will have more military and naval power in Southeast Asia. The only way for the West to contain China is to control the oil tap in the Middle East.</p>

<p>When our supposed global economic recovery is revealed to be nothing but smoke and mirrors, and tens of millions more Americans lose their jobs and the ability to put food on their tables, and they subsequently take to the streets to loot what they can, there will be few options left. One such option that <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/alex-jones/democide-government-killed-over-260-million-in-the-20th-century-poised-to-kill-billions-more-in-the-21st_03162012" target="_blank">democidal governments</a> have always kept in their back pockets is to start a war and divert attention away from the real problems facing their countries to manufactured enemies. It&#8217;s a tried and tested technique that has been used by conquerors and psychopaths for centuries, and they&#8217;re prepared to use it again when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>The threats posed by Syria have not only been manufactured, but are being actively fueled by this administration in an effort to sway the sentiment of the American people.</p>
<p>President Bush had weapons of mass destruction. The strategy worked so well that President Obama, less than a decade later, is using the exact same excuse for our need to involve hundreds of thousands of American lives in another mid east country &#8211; one that <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2012/06/confirmed-us-cia-arming-terrorists-in.html" target="_blank">we had a hand in destabilizing</a> from the get-go.</p>
<p>In his book and documentary, strategic relocation specialist Joel Skousen <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/strategic-relocation-where-to-go-when-it-hits-the-fan-full-movie_11162012" target="_blank">warns of the coming war involving Russia, China and the United States</a>.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re seeing now are the open stages of that war. It may still be &#8220;cold,&#8221; but you can be assured that the people in charge, along with their partners in the multi-billion dollar military industrial complex and financing cartels, are not only willing to start a war, they&#8217;re very much planning on this very outcome.</p>
<p>World War III <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/theyre-going-to-attempt-this-one-way-or-another-will-you-send-your-sons-and-daughters-to-fight-video_05302013" target="_blank">has already begun</a>, and those in power intend to send us, our children and our grandchildren to do their bidding.</p>

<p>They know your underwear size. They know where you drove your car today. They know what you put up on Facebook, texted to your wife and emailed to your friends. And they&#8217;ve done it all in the supposed interest of &#8220;national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>If, however, you were an Al Qaeda terrorist coordinating a large-scale prison break to free senior members of your mid-east terror organization, you would have been able to operate with impunity.</p>
<p>As you read the following report from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq keep in mind that the National Security Agency operates under authorization from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333" target="_blank">Executive Order 12333</a>. <strong>The agency was originally tasked not with &#8220;acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons,&#8221; but with analyzing information and data of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence value.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hundreds of convicts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">including senior members of al Qaeda</span>, broke out of Iraq&#8217;s Abu Ghraib jail as comrades launched a military-style assault to free them, authorities said on Monday.</strong></p>
<p>The deadly raid on the high-security jail happened as Sunni Muslim militants are gaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi&#8217;ite-led government that came to power after the U.S. invasion to oust Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives to the gates of the prison on the outskirts of Baghdad on Sunday night and blasted their way into the compound, while gunmen attacked guards with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
<p>Other militants took up positions near the main road, fighting off security reinforcements sent from Baghdad as several militants wearing suicide vests entered the prison on foot to help free the inmates.</p>
<p>Ten policemen and four militants were killed in the ensuing clashes, which continued until Monday morning, when military helicopters arrived, helping to regain control.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>The number of escaped inmates has reached 500, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most of them were convicted senior members of al Qaeda and had received death sentences</span></strong>,&#8221; Hakim Al-Zamili, a senior member of the security and defense committee in parliament, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The security forces arrested some of them, but <strong>the rest are still free</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>One security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity: &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously a terrorist attack carried out by al Qaeda to free convicted terrorists with al Qaeda.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/22/us-iraq-violence-idUSBRE96L0RM20130722" target="_blank">Reuters</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Two Words: <strong>EPIC FAIL</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While our government is supposedly preventing terrorism by <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-time-to-fight-back-is-now-striking-back-at-police-state-amerika_07222013" target="_blank">searching grandma at airports</a>, arresting kids <a href="http://www.infowars.com/teen-arrested-over-sarcastic-comment-on-video-game/" target="_blank">for making jokes on the internet</a>, deploying <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/obama-moves-to-authorize-domestic-drones-strikes-the-rules-outside-of-the-united-states-are-going-to-be-different-than-the-rules-inside-of-the-united-states_022013" target="_blank">thousands of drones</a> over America&#8217;s skies, and <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/08/greater-terror-risk-from-smaller-strike.html" target="_blank">looking for lone wolves</a>, they have failed at their absolute top priority: stopping actual terrorists from doing what terrorists do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The fact that an unknown number of senior members of Al Qaeda, who we as a nation likely spent hundreds of millions of dollars and countless lives to capture, have been freed from prison in what can only be described as a premeditated coordinated attack is a complete failure of our foreign intelligence directives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The challenge we now face is that senior Al Qaeda leaders who have likely been tortured and spent years in the hellhole of Abu Ghraib are now out in droves and they have one thing on their mind &#8211; to kill as many American men, women and children as they can before we catch or kill them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps our spy agencies and the highly trained individuals monitoring domestic data streams would better serve the national security of the American people by turning their efforts back to what they were originally intended to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Will this be a wake up call for our Chief Executive and his security Czars to focus the attention of our signals intelligence and security community to the real threat facing America?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or is identifying and stopping <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreign terrorists</span> no longer the priority?</p>

<p>Anyone that thinks that the U.S. economy can keep going along like this is absolutely crazy.  We are in the terminal phase of an unprecedented debt spiral which has allowed us to live far, far beyond our means for the last several decades.  Unfortunately, all debt spirals eventually end, and they usually do so in a very disorderly manner.  The chart that you are about to see is one of my favorite economic charts.  It compares the growth of U.S. GDP to the growth of total debt in the United States.  Yes, U.S. GDP has certainly grown at a decent pace over the years, but our total debt has absolutely exploded.  40 years ago, the total amount of debt in our system (government debt + corporate debt + consumer debt, etc.) was about 2 trillion dollars.  Today it has grown to <strong>more than 56 trillion dollars</strong>.  Our debt has grown at a much, much faster rate than our economy has, and there is no way in the world that we will be able to continue to do that for long.</p>
<p>Posted below is the chart that I was talking about.  The blue line is our total debt, and the red line is our GDP.  As you can see, this chart kind of speaks for itself&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19230" alt="Total-Debt-Growth-vs.-GDP-Growth-425x255" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Total-Debt-Growth-vs.-GDP-Growth-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></p>
<p>So how did we get here?</p>
<p>Well, of course the federal government has been the biggest offender.  It would be a tremendous understatement to say that the politicians in Washington D.C. have been reckless.  Since the year 2000, the size of the U.S. national debt has grown <a title="by more than 11 trillion dollars" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-stats-that-prove-the-u-s-economy-has-already-been-collapsing-over-the-past-decade">by more than 11 trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Posted below is a chart that demonstrates the dramatic growth of the national debt as a percentage of GDP.  In particular, our debt has absolutely exploded as a percentage of GDP since the financial crisis of 2008&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash/national-debt-as-a-percentage-of-gdp" rel="attachment wp-att-6126"><img alt="National Debt As A Percentage Of GDP" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/National-Debt-As-A-Percentage-Of-GDP-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>Does that look sustainable to you?</p>
<p>Of course it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Right now, the mainstream media is very excited that the federal budget deficit for this year might be less than a trillion dollars, but they are really missing the point.  The debt of the U.S. government is still growing much, much faster than the economy is, and the United States already has more government debt <a title="per capita" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/sites/all/files/images/-1.img_assist_custom-640x421.png" target="_blank">per capita</a> than Greece, Portugal, Italy, Ireland or Spain.</p>
<p>What we are doing to future generations is absolutely criminal.  We are piling up mountains of debt that will haunt them for the rest of their lives just so that we can make the present a little bit more pleasant for ourselves.</p>
<p>As I noted in <a title="another article" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-statistics-about-the-fall-of-the-u-s-economy-that-are-almost-too-crazy-to-believe">another article</a>, during Obama&#8217;s first term the federal government accumulated more debt than it did under <a title="the first 42 U.S presidents combined" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-obama-increased-debt-50521-household-more-first-42-presidents-53-terms" target="_blank">the first 42 U.S presidents combined</a>.  And now we are entering a time period when demographic forces are going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the finances of the federal government.</p>
<p>The Baby Boomers have started to retire, and they are going to want to start collecting on all of the financial promises that we have made to them.</p>
<p>As I have written about <a title="the other day" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/11-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-heading-straight-down-the-toilet" target="_blank">previously</a>, the number of Americans on Medicare is projected to grow from a little bit more than 50 million today to <a title="73.2 million" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/231267/is-america-running-out-of-doctors" target="_blank">73.2 million</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>The number of Americans collecting Social Security benefits is projected to grow from about 56 million today to <a title="91 million" href="http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-08-20-PNI0820wirSocial-SecurityOptionsADV20_ST_U.htm" target="_blank">91 million</a> in 2035.</p>
<p>Where are we going to get the money to pay for all of that?</p>
<p>Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff has calculated that the U.S. government is facing unfunded liabilities of <a title="222 trillion dollars" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/blink-u-s-debt-just-grew-by-11-trillion.html" target="_blank">222 trillion dollars</a> in the years ahead.</p>
<p>There is no simply no way that the U.S. government is going to be able to meet those obligations without wildly printing up money.</p>
<p>And of course the federal government is not the only one with massive debt problems.  We just saw <a title="the city of Detroit go bankrupt" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-facts-about-the-fall-of-detroit-that-will-leave-you-shaking-your-head">the city of Detroit go bankrupt</a>, and there are lots of other communities all over the nation that could soon follow.</p>
<p>Posted below is a chart that shows the growth of state and local government debt over the years.  In particular, please take note that the total amount of state and local government debt has grown from about 1.2 trillion dollars in the year 2000 to about 3 trillion dollars today&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/share-this-chart-with-anyone-that-believes-the-u-s-economy-is-not-going-to-crash/state-and-local-government-debt-4" rel="attachment wp-att-6125"><img alt="State And Local Government Debt" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/State-And-Local-Government-Debt-425x255.png" width="425" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>But the chart posted above does not even take into account the massive unfunded pension obligations that state and local governments are facing.  According to <a title="the Detroit Free Press" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/" target="_blank">the Detroit Free Press</a>, state governments are facing unfunded pension obligations of nearly a trillion and a half dollars&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>From Baltimore to Los Angeles, and many points in between, municipalities are increasingly confronted with how to pay for these massive promises. The Pew Center for the States, in Washington, estimated states’ public pension plans across the U.S. were underfunded by a whopping $1.4 trillion in 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>And many large cities are dealing with similar situations.  Detroit was the first to go down, but could <a title="Chicago or Los Angeles" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/" target="_blank">Chicago or Los Angeles</a> eventually be forced to declare bankruptcy too?&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Chicago recently saw its credit rating downgraded because of a $19-billion unfunded pension liability that the ratings service Moody’s puts closer to $36 billion. And Los Angeles could be facing a liability of more than $30 billion, by some estimates.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a report that was released earlier this year, the largest U.S. cities are facing <a title="hundreds of billions of dollars" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130721/NEWS06/307210073/" target="_blank">hundreds of billions of dollars</a> in unfunded pension liabilities at this point&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Early this year, the Pew Center released a survey showing that 61 of the nation’s largest cities — limiting the survey to the largest city in each state and all other cities with more than 500,000 people — had a gap of more than $217 billion in unfunded pension and health care liabilities. While cities had long promised health care, life insurance and other benefits to retirees, “few &#8230; started saving to cover the long-term costs,” the report said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where will all of that money come from?</p>
<p>That is a good question, and nobody has an easy answer at this point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. consumers have been racking up staggering amounts of debt over the past several decades.  Just consider the following numbers&#8230;</p>
<p>-Total home mortgage debt in the United States is now <a title="about 5 times larger" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/30-charts-you-must-see-before-buying-a-home-2011-4#-8" target="_blank">about 5 times larger</a> than it was just 20 years ago.</p>
<p>-Car loans just keep getting longer and longer, and approximately <a title="70 percent" href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/Howard_Dayton060506.aspx" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of all car purchases in the United States now involve an auto loan.</p>
<p>-The total amount of student loan debt in America recently surpassed<a title="the one trillion dollar mark" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-student-loan-debt-bubble-is-creating-millions-of-modern-day-serfs">the one trillion dollar mark</a>.</p>
<p>-One study discovered that <a title="approximately 41 percent" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/cf-7mu081908.php" target="_blank">approximately 41 percent</a> of all working age Americans either have medical bill problems or are currently paying off medical debt, and according to a report published in The American Journal of Medicine medical bills are a major factor in <a title="more than 60 percent" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH" target="_blank">more than 60 percent</a> of the personal bankruptcies in the United States.</p>
<p>-Consumer debt in the United States has risen by a whopping <a title="1700%" href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article31784.html" target="_blank">1700%</a>since 1971, and <a title="46% of all Americans" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/moneybuilder/2010/06/24/one-big-difference-between-chinese-and-american-households-debt/" target="_blank">46% of all Americans</a> carry a credit card balance from month to month.</p>
<p>Sadly, most people don&#8217;t realize how damaging credit card debt can be.  If you just carry an &#8220;average balance&#8221; on your credit cards each month, and those credit cards have just an &#8220;average&#8221; interest rate, you could end up paying <a title="millions of dollars" href="http://www.bankers-anonymous.com/uncategorized/part-iii-compound-interest-and-consumer-debt/#_ftn2" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a> to the credit card companies by the end of your life&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say you are an average American household, and you carry an average balance of $15,956 in credit card debt.</p>
<p>Also, as an average American household, let’s assume you pay an average current rate of 12.83%.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s assume you carry this average balance for 40 years, between ages 25 and 65.  How much did your credit card company make off of you and your extreme averageness?</p>
<p>Answer: $2,629,618.64</p></blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, a large percentage of the population does not seem to understand these things.  An astounding <a title="43 percent" href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/Howard_Dayton060506.aspx" target="_blank">43 percent</a> of all American families spend more than they earn each year.</p>
<p>Are you starting to understand why <a title="approximately half of all Americans" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/american-senior-citizens-die-broke-study-article-1.1130662" target="_blank">approximately half of all Americans</a> die broke?</p>
<p>We are a nation that is completely and addicted to debt.</p>
<p>If you do not believe that it will ever catch up with us you are being delusional.</p>
<p>We have piled up the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the planet, and a day of reckoning is fast approaching.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-19219" alt="policestateamerika1" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/policestateamerika1.jpg" width="240" height="163" />Every day a granny is goosed by TSA, a federal swat team raids the wrong house, a citizen acquitted of a crime still has their property confiscated by authorities, even the dumbed down public is aware that their every communication is monitored by the NSA and Obama has set his administration up to violate every constitutional right of every citizen in America under the NDAA and Executive Order 13603.</p>
<p>Anyone who possess an IQ above room temperature is aware that our federal government is totally out of control and is wreaking tyranny upon the American people. As a people, we have seemingly grown numb to the constitutional violations perpetrated by our government against the citizens of this country. However, the abuse of citizens does not begin and end with the federal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Trickle Down Tyranny</strong></p>
<p>With ever increasing frequency, the alternative media reports countless numbers of stories of citizen abuse at the hands of their local police and city officials. The local police departments have been federalized by DHS. They are provided millions of federal dollars for equipment and the new breed of police view the people as their enemy as opposed to the old cops walking a beat who previously viewed the majority of the people as their ally against crime. Through the influence of DHS, your local police department is looking to pounce on your every mistake with excessive force and brutality and they do so frequently while ignoring and violating any number of constitutional protections.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>When Is An Arrest Is Not Really An Arrest?</strong></p>
<p>Portland police officer Dean Halley must have failed his American Government class in high school. A reasonable person would also have to wonder if Portland Deputy City Attorney William Manlove got his law degree from Walmart. what am I referring to? Well, if the Scott Miller jaywalking case is any indication, the Portland legal system is one big fascist entity that is totally out of control.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-19220" alt="policestateamerika2" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/policestateamerika2.png" width="176" height="212" />Scott Miller was running late to work. In an effort to catch his bus, he diagonally jaywalked in the crosswalk to catch his rid.</p>
<p>Portland police officer Dean Halley was on patrol and was able to intervene just in the nick of time and arrest this menace to society. Halley approached Miller and told him to produce identification. Miller was subsequently fumbling around on his person looking for his ID when Halley immediately pounced on Miller, knocked him to the ground, informed Miller that he was under arrest and placed him in <a href="http://yorktowntradingpost.com/?s=Scott+Miller+" target="_blank">handcuffs</a>. Halley subsequently confined Miller in the back of his police cruiser and then proceeded to drive the criminal jaywalker a block away. The total ordeal lasted 30 minutes, but while in the police cruiser, Miller experienced a panic attack and paramedics were dispatched to the scene to administer aid. Miller was subsequently convicted in court of failure to obey a traffic signal.</p>
<p>Miller has obtained an attorney, Leonard Berman, and Miller is attempting to sue the Portland Police Department for an illegal arrest because jaywalking is not an offense that one can be arrested for.</p>
<p>Halley, a 20 year police veteran, <a href="http://yorktowntradingpost.com/?s=Scott+Miller+" target="_blank">admits</a> he told Miller that he was under arrest. However, Deputy City Attorney <a href="http://yorktowntradingpost.com/?s=Scott+Miller+" target="_blank">William Manlove</a> is arguing that citizens cannot sue under these circumstances because such acts do not constitute an actual arrest. Manlove stated that the encounter between Halley and Miller amounted to no more than a “chat.” Manlove characterized the encounter as being something “between a chat and custody, but not an arrest for purposes of legal action.” Are you kidding me?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>The Real Crime Committed by Officer Halley</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take Manlove’s twisted version of the encounter between Halley and Miller, and blindly conclude that Halley did not arrest Miller, despite knocking him down, telling him he was under arrest, handcuffing him, placing him in the police car and drove him a block away. For the sake of argument let’s be in agreement with Manlove that this was just a friendly chat. Under these circumstances that both sides agree upon, was there a crime committed by Halley? You bet there was. The first crime committed by Halley is called aggravated assault. Halley was presumably armed and attacked Miller knocking him to the ground. When Halley handcuffed Miller, he committed the offense of unlawful imprisonment just the same when one abusing spouse will not let their partner leave the premises. And the biggest crime committed by Halley is that this officer is guilty of kidnapping which is what it is called when someone forcibly detains a person and removes them to another location. Please keep in mind that jaywalking is an offense for which a person cannot be arrested for committing. In the upside down world of the Portland legal system, Miller gets convicted in court and Halley is not in jail for aggravated assault, unlawful detention and kidnapping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>What Is Wrong With Portland Is a Microcosm of the US</strong></p>
<p>Who among has never jaywalked? All of us are risk to be the next victim of this tyranny. Unfortunately, the behavior of officer Halley and City Attorney Manlove is typical of most police departments and their prosecutors. They get off on the rush of lording power over others. Prosecutors think that they will move ahead in their careers with high conviction rates and many of the police think the same by looking to arrest as many people as possible and going so far as to even inventing crimes for which to arrest the public for. This is why the United States contains 25% of the world’s prison population despite only having 5% of the world’s population.The US is number one in the world in people who are incarcerated.</p>
<p>Portland, like almost every other city is broke and has been under an <a href="http://www.solidarityagainstausterity.org/" target="_blank">austerity plan</a> for the past couple of years. This encourages the cops to hide behind the bushes and catch as many speeders as possible. Cops, in short, are mandated to be mobile tax collectors and they are looking for any excuse to make arrests for the most minor of offenses. These behaviors are not compatible with a supposedly free society.</p>
<p>In preparation for this article, I have been watching some episodes from the TV show, <em><strong>Cops</strong>,</em> in order to assess the quality of interactions with the public. In one episode I viewed, a cop pulls over a cyclist for coasting through a stop sign in a quiet residential neighborhood. Just like officer Halley, the Sacramento cop thinks this provides him with the right to violate the man’s Fourth Amendment rights. With no probable cause to search the man’s backpack and person, the cop does just that. The man had a marijuana pipe in his backpack and off to jail he goes in another stunning example of your tax dollars at work.Before you tell me that the man got his just desserts, please read the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>In another episode, the Tampa police were conducting undercover marijuana sales to motorists. As part of the bust, an unmarked cop car speeds out of a hiding place and rams the front end of the drug buyers car. When a couple of the arrested individuals protested the ramming of their cars, a Tampa cop repeatedly states that “this is no longer your car, we own it and you will have to buy it back from us.”</p>
<p>I don’t use drugs and I have not smoked marijuana, but you have to be kidding me when we asked to believe that the cops have the right seize anyone’s car for a small amount of marijuana. What if the buyers had purchased their marijuana on foot, would their shoes or possibly their clothes been stolen by the Tampa Police Department? These thugs with a badge will also take your house for having small amounts of marijuana in their house. Whose interests are these cops serving?</p>
<p>The TV show that takes the case is <strong><i>Bait Car</i>.</strong> As an aside, I have had my car stolen twice and I wanted the perpetrators arrested and prosecuted. I want gangster drug dealers busted and sent to prison. However, do we really want to send marijuana users to prison? When is it good law enforcement to bait people into committing a crime they might not otherwise commit? This is true of undercover drug sales of personal use quantities of drugs and it is definitely true when the cops bait people into stealing their bait car by making it inviting. Isn’t there enough crime that should occupy law enforcement without entrapping the public? However, one should remember that the prisons are being transitioned into for profit ventures and the cops and prosecutors are all too happy to cooperate with the Bush family et al in this venture. Who really thinks that this represents good law enforcement? Yet, the show <i>Bait Car</i>, is all about entrapping people who might not otherwise commit a crime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>The Small Town of Deer Trail, CO. Is Leading the Way In the Fight Against Tyranny</strong></p>
<p>The town board Deer Trail, CO., is <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23676390/deer-trail-considers-hunting-licenses-drones" target="_blank">considering an ordinance</a>  in which residents may soon be allowed to shoot down drones. The ordinance would permit people with hunting licenses to fire bullets at the hated drones. Also, the town would also pay these drone hunters $100 for each “mechanical hide” with federal markings. Is there anyone reading this that is not smiling from ear to ear?</p>
<p>I do not really think it is a good idea to be shooting bullets up in the air because they can return to earth with devastating consequences. But in this small town, someone is finally showing the intestinal fortitude that is needed in this country in order to fight back against federal and local tyranny. The proposed ordinance is certainly more symbolic than real. However, it is a start and you know that somewhere in the DOD, they just discovered where Deer Trail, CO. is located on a map. We need more Deer Trails.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>What Can Be Done in Cities Like Portland</strong></p>
<p>Although we don’t want to be shooting bullets in the air at drones, there are things we can do to fight against an out of control government and its increasing level of criminality.</p>
<p>Portland citizens should consider conducting a mass jaywalking night and do so in front of the police headquarters. Portland should also sponsor a “film the police” night. People armed with their cell phones should video tape every police action that they witness. If the cops know that they are under increased surveillance, then they might behave and the officer Halley’s of the law enforcement world will find their next job at Walmart conducting parking lot security as their transgressions are caught on tape and they rightfully lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Yes I know, that people have been arrested for filming the police. When that happens the people of that community need to recall their mayor for facilitating state sponsored terrorism against their citizens. This is what should already be happening in Portland. I say that if the police want to put the people under such undue surveillance, we the people need to return the favor. In places like Portland, businesses should not be serving law enforcement personnel and prosecutors. Prosecutors such as Portland Deputy City Attorney, Manlove and officer Halley, should not be able to find a place to do their laundry. Apartment owners should refuse to rent to these “types”.</p>
<p>Don’t let your children play with their children. After filming cops and their transgressions, show up at city council meetings with still photographs and present them at the public comment period. Start Youtube channels which features public officials and their wrongdoings. Take pictures of the weeds in their yards and send the photos and a request for action to their local HOA’s. Embarrass any government and law enforcement official with public exposure when they break the law and violate the civil liberties of their citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>All Politics Is Not Local</strong></p>
<p>Local boycotts and protests are certainly easier to implement on a local level. However, the same principles need to be employed against federal officials. Treat them and their families like they have the plague. IRS and NSA officials should be treated like the colonists did the Stamp Tax collectors in pre-Revolutionary War period.</p>
<p>If you own a mid-size business, go to video conferencing strategies in order to conduct long distance activities. Send the airlines a letter telling them that you are not subjecting your employees to the tyranny of the TSA and your people will not be flying. If enough of us did that, the TSA would fade away instead of expanding to trains, bus depots and highways. The entire country needs to be sending such a letter to the airlines. For when US Airways, Southwest and the other virtual airline monopolies are financially hurting, they will be screaming at the federal government to change their corrupt system.<br />
To strike back at the criminal IRS, shop at garage sales. Trade and barter as much as you can. Refuse to use one of the five megabanks as a lender to buy a house in response to the MERS robo-signer mortgage fraud. Use your local credit union for all loans. Follow the same advice for buying a car. In fact, you should not buy a car until you can pay cash for it. Take the debt advantage away from the banksters that have hijacked our government. Refuse to shop at a corporate chain store such as Kmart, Walmart or any other slavemart store and shop locally. Unlike the failed LA riots of 1992, we do not have to burn down our own neighborhoods to make a statement. We just need to withdraw our support and our money.</p>
<p><strong>Educate Your Children Outside the System</strong></p>
<p>American families need to ban together and educate their children outside the system as much as possible. Someone just brought to my attention that some fully accredited foreign universities are having discussions aboutoffering online classes to American college students at a fraction of the cost in response to the tyrannical post-secondary education system that is running the show in the US. These foreign entrepreneurs are looking to profit from the predatory practices being exhibited our post-secondary institutions. The student loan debacle in this country is highly criminal and is extremely predatory and should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-19221" alt="policestateamerika3" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/policestateamerika3.jpg" width="232" height="176" />Homeschooling will soon be outlawed in the US for the same reasons it was outlawed in Germany. The establishment wants people smart enough to do their job, but not so smart that they can question authority. This does not change the responsibility factor of parents who need to redouble their efforts to not let their children believe that the constitutional violations happening in our country are acceptable.</p>
<p>Parents need to focus on raising their children to respect the rule of law (i.e. the Constitution), not the thuggery that has replaced the rule of law. The globalists need to know that no generation of Americans will ever accept and fully submit to their tyranny and eventually the banksters day of justice will come.</p>
<blockquote><p>Explore alternatives. Non-participation is the ultimate blow to any corrupt organization.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-19222" alt="policestateamerika4" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/policestateamerika4.jpg" width="230" height="140" />You must attend your Congressman’s next Town Hall Meeting. Show up and tell them that you will work to unelect them unless they subject themselves to the same substandard and dangerous Obamacare system that they have sentenced us to. Unelect all incumbents until they repeal this genocidal, death panel ridden form of health care. And the same standard of political retention needs to be applied to the repeal of the Stasi inspired NDAA.</p>
<p>I do not have the space to present all of my ideas on striking back at what I dub “Police State Amerika,” but I am sure my point is not lost on those who have a backbone and a pulse.<br />
Did I mention to store and grow your own food, store water and hide your guns and ammo? Do these three things now in preparation for the possible time that you may need them when the Russian/NATO/UN troops come knocking at your door. Don’t make the mistake of believing that when the Russians show up at your door to seize your guns, that officer Halley will respond to save the day.</p>
<p><strong>Nonviolence Does Not Imply Compliance</strong></p>
<p>It is time people for the spirit of civil disobedience to rear its head. Short of not complying with any form of gun confiscation. The type of peaceful revolution that I am proposing can be effective without ever firing a shot. Those that know me, know that I am nonviolent. However, that does not mean that I will not become non compliant against this encroaching tyrannical police state.</p>
<p>If we are going down as a country, I am not submitting without a fight. Will you join me? The time to fight back is now! What is your idea on how to fight back against this tyranny? Please leave a comment with your suggestion.Writing your suggestions is the first step towards action. If you care about your country and your children’s future, let your voice be heard.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><small>(Pictured: Draganflyer X6 domestic surveillance drone over Mesa, CO)</small></em></p>
<p>In response to overwhelming public support for a new ordinance in the small Colorado town of Deer Trail, which would <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/town-to-issue-licenses-and-bounties-to-shoot-down-drones-they-fly-in-town-they-get-shot-down-video_07172013" target="_blank">issue hunting licenses and bounties for shooting down unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, the Federal Aviation Administration has warned that penalties for those who engage drones could be severe.</p>
<blockquote><p>The FAA released a statement in response to questions about an ordinance under consideration in the tiny farming community of Deer Trail, Colo., that would encourage hunters to shoot down drones. The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation&#8217;s airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.</p>
<p>A drone &#8220;hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/faa-warns-public-against-shooting-guns-drones" target="_blank">AP</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Phillip Steel, who authored the original proposal in Deer Trail, Colorado says his ordinance is a &#8220;pre-emptive strike&#8221;  against what he calls a &#8220;virtual prison&#8221; being created through continued expansion of the surveillance state.</p>
<blockquote><p>He dismissed the FAA&#8217;s warning. &#8220;The FAA doesn&#8217;t have the power to make a law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The FAA is working on regulations to safely integrate drones into the skies over the U.S., where manned aircraft are prevalent. The Congress gave the FAA until 2015 to develop the regulations, but the agency is behind schedule. FAA officials have estimated that once regulations are in place, thousands of drones will be in use across the country for a wide variety of purposes, from helping farmers figure out which crops need watering to tracking sea lions in remote rocky outcroppings to aiding search and rescue missions.</p>
<p>But the Deer Trail proposal is the latest ripple in a spreading backlash against drones. Dozens of laws aimed at curbing the use of the unmanned aircraft have been introduced in states and cities. Privacy advocates have expressed fear that police will use drones to cheaply and effectively conduct widespread surveillance without warrants.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the FAA was forced to issue a warning suggests that drones, despite their popularity in government and law enforcement circles, are not as popular as some may think, especially in the aftermath of the NSA surveillance scandal that involves the cataloging, analyzing and <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/twenty-trillion-phone-calls-theyve-been-collecting-data-about-all-domestic-calls-since-october-2001_06102013" target="_blank">archiving of some 20 trillion electronic records</a> that include phone calls and emails.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.infowars.com/dhs-advances-plan-for-public-safety-drones/" target="_blank">recently advanced a plan</a> to deploy “public safety” drones in the skies over America, an action <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2012/02/09/congress-approves-30000-spy-drones-over-america-as-us-police-state-tightens/" target="_blank">Congress authorized last year</a> calling for the deployment of 30,000 drone surveillance vehicles by 2020.</p>
<p>The increased dependence of domestic law enforcement and military personnel on drone technology has left Americans concerned that like the thousands of innocent civilians being killed by these faceless robots overseas in various anti-terror campaigns, they, too, may become enemies of the State under powers authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act and the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/obama-admits-to-killing-four-americans.html" target="_blank">four American citizens were killed by a drone strike</a> approved by the President of The United States. They were <em>suspected</em> of terrorist activity and killed without due process.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, President Obama hinted that he <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/obama-moves-to-authorize-domestic-drones-strikes-the-rules-outside-of-the-united-states-are-going-to-be-different-than-the-rules-inside-of-the-united-states_022013" target="_blank">has the authority to initiate domestic drone strikes against American citizens</a>, though he suggested the rules for such attacks inside of the United States would be different from those governing actions on foreign soil.</p>

They cite various data points to make the case that the multi-trillion dollar bailouts and stimulus have brought us back from the brink of a collapse so serious that <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/forecasting/are-you-100-sure-they-saved-the-system_02012010" target="_blank">Congressional leaders had been told</a> that should the bailouts fail, there was a real possibility of martial law being declared.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing so well, in fact, that just a couple of years ago President Obama <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/says-it-aint-so-joe-vp-declares-its-a-depression-biden-vs-obama-video_06272012" target="_blank">assured the nation</a> of our progress, claiming that we &#8220;<em><strong>reversed the recession, avoided a depression, [and] got the economy moving again.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>But were one to take a step back from the rhetoric of talking heads, political leaders and so-called Wall Street experts, a completely different picture begins to emerge.</p>
<p>Just this week <a href="http://www.thedailycrux.com/Post/43073/housing-shocker-details-on-today-s-biggest-miss-in-history-" target="_blank">it was announced</a> that not only are housing starts plummeting, but permit applications reported their &#8220;largest miss in history,&#8221; an indicator that the economy is not as healthy as it has been made out to be. And, while stock markets are hitting all-time record highs, what&#8217;s curious is that some of the world&#8217;s largest companies, including Intel, IBM, Google, Ebay and FedEx, are <a href="http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?blog=Market-Ticker&amp;page=2" target="_blank">reporting significant consumer pull back</a> and earnings below analyst expectations.</p>
<p>And if that hasn&#8217;t convinced you, then here is the reality of the situation directly from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the architect of the most massive economic recovery &#8220;plan&#8221; ever devised in the history of the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the Fed can get interest rates up very much, because the economy is weak, inflation rates are low,&#8221; Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were to tighten policy, the economy would tank.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>(<a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/breaking-news/no-rate-rise-on-horizon-bernanke/story-fnihsevj-1226681221841" target="_blank">Courier Mail</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What Helicopter Ben is saying, despite his pledge to start pulling back the monthly $85 billion (Over $1 Trillion yearly) in stimulus spending by mid-2014, is that if they stop injecting financial and bond markets with capital, the whole system is going to fall apart, just like it was going to in 2008.</p>
<p>There is no way out for Ben Bernanke&#8217;s policies. We&#8217;re toast either way. If we keep printing, we eventually hyperinflate our currency to oblivion, leaving our entire system of commerce at a standstill. If we stop printing the system &#8220;tanks,&#8221; as noted by the Chairman.</p>
<p>The end result, any way you slice it, is complete and <a href="http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=222822" target="_blank">total detonation</a> of our financial, economic and monetary systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>His answer?  <em>The economy will tank.</em></p>
<p>Did that tell you everything you needed to know?</p>
<p>It should have.</p>
<p><strong>He can&#8217;t exit<strong>.  </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Not now, not ever.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong><strong>Which paradoxically, means he will exit because if an outcome is inevitable then the longer you wait and the more distortion you pump in before it happens the worse it is</strong> and he cannot avoid owning the outcome either way</strong></em>.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Think it through folks.</p>
<p>Then get ready, because <strong>it&#8217;s coming</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the 2008 crisis, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was quoted as saying that the United States was <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/government-actions-have-prevented-depression-financial-meltdown-and-martial-law_03012010" target="_blank">on the brink</a> of a total collapse, something his successor <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/confirmed-were-literally-on-the-brink-of-catastrophic-collapse_01062011" target="_blank">Tim Geithner echoed</a> in an open letter to Congress.</p>
<p>This is happening, and our Federal Reserve Chairman just confirmed it.</p>
<p>Ignore it at your peril.</p>

<p>Not only are they set to vote on hunting licenses authorizing the shoot down of unmanned aerial vehicles hovering over their town, but they&#8217;ll be issued a $100 bounty if they can prove they did it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The small town of Deer Trail, Colorado is considering a bold move. The town board will be voting on an ordinance that would create drone hunting licenses and offer bounties for unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
<p>Deer Trail resident, Phillip Steel, drafted the ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We do not want drones in town,&#8221; said Steel. &#8220;They fly in town, they get shot down.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s against the law to destroy federal property, Steel&#8217;s proposed ordinance outlines weapons, ammunition, rules of engagement, techniques, and bounties for drone hunting.</p>
<p>The ordinates states,<strong> &#8220;The Town of Deer Trail shall issue a reward of $100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the United States federal government.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zimmerman Verdict Spurs an Outbreak of…Temper Tantrums?</strong><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>While <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/propaganda-storm-hollywood-unites-with-100s-of-tweets-against-zimmerman-verdict-07142013#comment-18046" target="_blank">Hollywood and the media puppets</a> play their harps, write their poetry, and weep gracefully over the Zimmerman verdict, riots erupt across the United States.</p>
<p>Except, as any mom or dad who has ever raised a child through the toddler years will recognize, they aren’t really “riots” but temper tantrums.  It is like a bunch of hungry, overtired children, melting down and having a big, screaming hissy fit.</p>
<p>Basically, these people who are angry about the Zimmerman verdict are stomping their feet, running around, shouting, crying, and breaking things…just because they’re mad.</p>
<p>They are doing absolutely nothing that will effect a change, nothing that will increase their own credibility, and nothing that will prove to the world that they are right and the Zimmerman jury was wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-19176" alt="crenshaw-martin-zimmerman-la-protest" src="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/crenshaw-martin-zimmerman-la-protest.jpg" width="433" height="244" /></p>
<p>Wouldn’t peaceful protests with large numbers of citizens standing in unity get across the point that they are trying to prove with more clarity?  Aren’t these people trying to show that an injustice was done, that Zimmerman should not have been fearful of Trayvon Martin?  By rioting through city streets, threatening and hurting innocent bystanders, aren’t these “protesters” proving the complete opposite of their alleged point?</p>

<p>With this complete lack of dignity, you can’t even call these actions “protests” – you have to call them what they are – temper tantrums.  Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>From Los Angeles</p>
<blockquote><p>Several protesters ran into a Wal-Mart store and knocked down displays before store security chased them out. Police began guarding the door.</p>
<p>Tonya Williams was shopping with her daughter when the protesters burst in and security briefly locked down the store.</p>
<p>“We thought we were going to be stuck in there,” Williams said. “We saw the merchandise all thrown around. They had pulled the rack down, and there was merchandise all over the floor.”  (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-protesters-raid-la-store-075210080.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>From Pennsylvania:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Chester County, Pennsylvania, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9172652">police</a> are investigating graffiti on a building before it was set on fire: “KILL ZIMMERMAN.” Firefighters were called to the scene of the fire at ProSigns, a company manufacturing commercial signs for business, and found that phrase spray-painted in red on the front of the building. The firefighters put out the fire without significant damage. The fire has been ruled arson.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Zimmerman protesters shut down I-880" src="http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/400/img/photos/2013/07/15/dd/03/OakZimmer8802.jpg" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From Oakland:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dozens of demonstrators briefly blocked all lanes of Interstate 880 at the tail end of rush hour, stopping traffic in both directions for several minutes before lanes were cleared by authorities. Several protesters laid their bicycles on the ground in front of stopped cars.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to go. You will go to jail,” one police officer shouted at demonstrators who were blocking traffic, the Oakland Tribune reported. However, police decided not to make arrests as the marchers, chanting “Justice for Trayvon Martin,” were directed back to surface streets.</p>
<p>Later, another group tried to march up the onramp to Interstate 580 before being turned away by Oakland police and California Highway Patrol officers.

<p>Also from Oakland:</p>
<blockquote><p>There were scattered reports of vandalism — including Dumpsters pulled into the street — but not at the level of destruction that happened Saturday night when numerous downtown businesses had windows smashed or were covered in spray paint.. (<a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/crime-law/bay-area-protests-over-zimmerman-verdict-continue/nYrXY/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPHUmC4CAAEngkw.jpg" width="479" height="358" /></p>
<p>Across the San Francisco Bay area:</p>
<blockquote><p> A BART police car parked outside the 12th Street BART Station had its windows smashed, and protesters spray-painted “F- the police” and “Kill Pigs” on the side of the vehicle… The crowd later moved away from the intersection and headed east on 14th Street, stopping at a McDonald’s restaurant shortly after midnight to burn several flags and to spray-paint “Kill Zimmerman” and “FTP,” an anti-police epithet, on the side of Alameda County’s Rene C. Davidson Courthouse. (<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2013/07/14/Rioters-Break-Windows-And-Tagging-Police-Car-With-Kill-Pigs-Over-Verdict" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporters were also a target in Oakland…but why?  Those are the people who were there to do what the protests were allegedly supposed to do – get the story out about the outrage at the verdict:</p>
<blockquote><p>…a small number of Oakland demonstrators — some hiding their faces with bandanas, as demonstrators did during the <a id="EVGAP00020" title="Occupy Oakland" href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics/activism/protest/occupy-oakland-EVGAP00020.topic">Occupy Oakland</a> melees — turned violent late Sunday, setting upon an Oakland Tribune photographer and KTVU cameraman with kicks and punches.</p>
<p>“I’m OK, but protesters had our photog on the ground,” Bay Area News Group reporter Natalie Neysa Alund <a href="https://twitter.com/nataliealund">tweeted</a> a little before 11:30 p.m. Sunday. “I tried to get them off him. An #SFgate photog came to the rescue — 1 camera is destroyed.”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, another reporter with the news group — which publishes the Oakland Tribune, Contra Costa Times and San Jose Mercury News — followed up: “Just patched up my assailed colleague. He’s shaken but not stirred. Should be ok. Senseless.”</p>
<p>A KTVU tweet said that news agency’s cameraman was also “attacked by masked protesters.” (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-oakland-protesters-angered-by-zimmerman-acquittal-rough-up-news-photographers-20130715,0,3507597.story?track=rss" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the riots resulted in serious harm…but what is the point of injuring a person because of the color of his skin? Isn’t that what the “protesters” are protesting <strong><em>against</em></strong>?</p>
<p>From Baltimore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real estate agent Christina Dudley said she was walking to her car just before 9 p.m. when she saw several young black males and two black females chasing a 37-year-old Hispanic man west on North Linwood Avenue past East Fairmont Avenue.</p>
<p>“One of the boys had a handgun out and it was pointed at the back of him,” Dudley said in an interview.</p>
<p>They caught up to the man at the corner of Fairmount and N. Streeper Street, and the male with the gun beat the victim with what appeared to be his gun while others kicked and stomped him, Dudley said.</p>
<p>“They were just yelling and calling him names as they ran after him, but once they were hitting him and after that they started yelling, “This is for Trayvon, [expletive],” said Dudley, who heard the chant repeated multiple times. (<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-monday-20130715,0,5135359.story#ixzz2ZERHMWB3" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>From Mississippi:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man who says he was jogging alongside of a road when three black men abducted and beat him claims the alleged attack was in retaliation for George Zimmerman’s acquittal, police in Senatobia, Miss. told Fox News.</p>
<p>Police Chief Steve Holts told Fox News the alleged victim, who is white, was jogging Sunday night along Highway 51 when, he said, the suspects pulled over and ordered him to get inside their car.</p>
<p>“One of them asked, ‘Do you know who Trayvon Martin was?’” Holts quoted the man as saying.  At that point, the men in the vehicle allegedly attacked him.</p>
<p>The man, who the chief described as a young resident of  the area, was treated  at a local hospital.</p>
<p>Memphis television station WREG reported the assailants allegedly told the victim, “This is for Trayvon.” The television station and The Democrat newspaper reported the jogger was badly beaten and later dropped off on a road between Senatobia and Coldwater, Miss. (<a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/22850763/jogger-says-he-was-attacked-in-retaliation-for-zimmerman-verdict#axzz2Z8TvGzrd" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, clearly, it should be judged a hate crime when George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, but it should be considered an act of protest when they beat up a bystander “for Trayvon” , selecting their victim just because he happens to be white or Hispanic.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who are peacefully protesting the verdict, as is their Constitutionally protected right to do.  Unfortunately, the positivity and unity that they are trying to convey is being overridden by a bunch of kids having a tantrum. As Ted Nugent wrote, “Martin Luther King Jr. is rolling over in his grave that he sacrificed his life for the cause of judging people by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, as so many of his own race carry in in self-destructive behavior while professional race mongers blame everything on racism.” (Check out his essay on the subject of the Zimmerman verdict <a href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-verdict-vindicates-citizen-patrols-self-defense/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.)</p>
<p>The people participating in this big national melt-down are actually doing more to vindicate George Zimmerman’s actions last February than the jury did when they acquitted him.  They are, without direct provocation, destroying property, committing arson, beating the daylights out of people because of their skin color, and purposely attempting to incite fear.  They are perpetuating the racial stereotypes they claim to be railing against.</p>
<p>So, judging by these childish and vicious tantrums, why <em>wouldn’t</em> people be feeling rather suspicious?</p>
<p>Someone needs to take away their spray paint and their matches, and then send them to their rooms so the adults can have a conversation.</p>
