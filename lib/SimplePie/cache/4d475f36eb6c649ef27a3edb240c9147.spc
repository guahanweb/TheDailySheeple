<p>This is a guy that does not make a lot of money.  He mostly does shows for kids <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/18/marty-the-magician-rabbit-disaster-plan/">at schools and at libraries</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Marty Hahne, or <a title="http://www.martythemagician.com/" href="http://www.martythemagician.com/" target="_blank">Marty the Magician</a> as he is known to school groups around Springfield, Mo., where he makes a living making his rabbit, Casey, magically appear in a variety of places (birthday gift, miniature library, cookie jar), is headlining a ventriloquists’ convention in Cincinnati this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>You would think that the federal government would have much better things to do than to shake down a small-time magician with one rabbit.  Unfortunately, the control freaks that run things are not about to let anyone off the hook&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires the rabbit to be licensed, which is weird enough, but where things enter the rabbit warren of the truly bizarre is a new USDA rule seven years in the making.</p>
<p>Marty must have a rabbit disaster “plan” in place by July 29, 2013, in case of calamity — “flooding,” “earthquake,” “landslide/mudslide/avalanche,” “wildfire,” “intentional attack,” to name a few examples.</p>
<p>“My country is broke,” Mr. Hahne says. “We are out of money, and now the government is spending time, and money, worrying about an emergency plan for a bunny rabbit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, a woman named Kim Morgan that specializes in writing emergency plans for federal agencies heard about what Mr. Hahne was going through and offered to draft the 32 page disaster plan for free.</p>
<p>But of course this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon.  We are a country that literally has millions of laws, rules and regulations and that is drowning underneath an ocean of red tape.</p>
<p>And it gets worse with each passing year.  For example, just check out what <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/23/technology/security/obamacare-privacy/index.html?iid=HP_River">one recent CNN article</a> had to say about the &#8220;privacy nightmare&#8221; that the new federal Obamacare database is going to create&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When shoppers apply for health insurance through the forthcoming state-based Obamacare exchanges, the online system will verify each applicant&#8217;s information by pulling in data from more than half a dozen federal agencies ranging from the IRS to the Peace Corps. It will know who you are, how much money you make, and whether or not you&#8217;re in the United States legally.</p>
<p>The prospect of one online system having access to so much personal information is making some watchdogs nervous. In a USA Today op-ed decrying the system as a &#8220;privacy nightmare,&#8221; researchers Stephen Parente and Paul Howard penned these scary words: &#8220;This hub will achieve what has, until now, only appeared in pulp thrillers: a central database linking critical state and federal data on every U.S. citizen for real-time access.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much of a bureaucratic nightmare that is going to be?  Government bureaucrats are going to have access to all of our health information, and they will instantly know where we have failed to comply with the countless new rules and regulations that are being implemented as a part of Obamacare.</p>
<p>It is going to be an absolutely gigantic ball of red tape.  It will be a bureaucratic paradise.</p>
<p>So what can we do about all of this?</p>
<p>Individually, not a whole lot.  But there are some states that are starting to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>For example, the following are some excerpts from a recent email that someone sent to me about what is going on in Oklahoma&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oklahoma law passed, 37 to 9 an amendment to place the Ten Commandments on the front entrance to the state capitol. The feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey this is a conservative state, based on Christian values&#8230;! HB 1330</p>
<p>Guess what&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>Oklahoma recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. HB 1804. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU, they said it would be a mistake.</p>
<p>Guess what&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I&#8217;m sure that was a setback for the criminals. The Liberals didn&#8217;t like it &#8212; But&#8230;.</p>
<p>Guess what&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Oklahoma did it anyway.</p>
<p>Just this month, the state has voted and passed a law that ALL drivers’ license exams will be printed in English, and only English, and no other language. They have been called racist for doing this, but the fact is that ALL of the road signs are in English only. If you want to drive in Oklahoma, you must read and write English. Really simple.</p>
<p>By the way, the Liberals don&#8217;t like any of this either.</p>
<p>Guess what&#8230;who cares&#8230; Oklahoma is doing it anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States is not supposed to be a centrally-planned society where control freak bureaucrats watch, track, monitor and control virtually everything that we do.</p>
<p>We are supposed to be a society that maximizes privacy, freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>Sadly, at this point we are becoming more like centrally-planned societies such as China every single day.  And if you want an idea of what life in a society that has a very high degree of central planning is like, just check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG-meaGqg-M">this video</a> of a subway station during morning rush hour in Beijing&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xG-meaGqg-M" height="338" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A photo of the overcrowding in the subway station in the video above was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeXu/status/358159158786269184/photo/1">posted on Twitter</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/obama-administration-requires-magician-to-submit-a-32-page-disaster-plan-for-his-rabbit/subway-station-in-beijing" rel="attachment wp-att-3605"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3605" alt="Subway Station In Beijing" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Subway-Station-In-Beijing-460x342.jpg" width="460" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>Is that how we want to live?</p>
<p>To the central planners, we are all essentially nameless, faceless cattle that need to be herded in the right direction.</p>
<p>And the central planners always believe that they know better than us.  They believe that we cannot be trusted with freedom and liberty because we cannot handle it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, central planners usually end up making a giant mess of things. And right now they are making a huge mess of the United States. If we don&#8217;t stop them, they will continue to wreck our once great nation.</p>

<p>Four elderly men in Houston were recently rescued from the <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9178043">&#8220;dungeon&#8221;</a> that they were being held in.  The goal of their captors was apparently to confiscate their Social Security and veteran benefits checks&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Four men found living in &#8220;deplorable conditions&#8221; in a Houston garage told police that they were being held captive after being lured by promises of alcohol and cigarettes so that their captor could cash their public-assistance checks, authorities said.</p></blockquote>
<p>When police arrived at the place they were being held, they found that the doors had literally been nailed shut&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Around 8am Friday, a neighbor called 911, fearing there some was something suspicious going on in the home. Police say when they arrived they discovered four men living in some sort of converted garage without beds or even a restroom.</p>
<p>One by one, the alleged captives were taken away on stretchers. They&#8217;re sick, malnourished and confused. Police say they were being held in the home against their will &#8212; possibly for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doors were nailed shut, barred shut with small nails,&#8221; said HPD Sgt. JW McCoy. &#8220;One of them said they had been held there for up to 10 years. One of them said he&#8217;d been there a few years, and the other one didn&#8217;t know how long he&#8217;d been there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2 The &#8220;Bash Mobs&#8221; Of Southern California</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years, &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/flash-mob-crimes-and-organized-looting-have-become-a-normal-part-of-life-in-america">flash mob crimes</a>&#8221; have become increasingly popular.  According to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bash-mobs-southern-california-20130719,0,1569435.story">the Los Angeles Times</a>, police in Southern California are now calling these group crime waves &#8220;Bash Mobs&#8221; and they are deeply concerned about the surge in these types of events in recent days&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Organized &#8220;bash mob&#8221; crime rampages of roving groups attacking innocent people and businesses have been striking cities around the United States. Law enforcement agencies in Southern California have reported few similar problems &#8212; until now.</p>
<p>In the last several days, there have been several reports of such group crime waves in South L.A., Hollywood, San Bernardino and Victorville. Long Beach police are bracing for another one Friday.</p>
<p>These so-called bash mobs of &#8220;flash mob&#8221; crime waves are organized through social media and have been a problem in Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#3 16-Year-Old Girl Raped, Thrown Off Roof</strong></p>
<p>How sick do you have to be to <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Rape-Girl-Thrown-Roof-Police-Suspect-Crime-Attempted-Murder-216135941.html">rape a 16-year-old girl</a> and then throw her off a roof?&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Police have arrested one man and are searching for a second suspect after they allegedly lured a 16-year-old girl to a Brooklyn roof, where they raped her before throwing her off,  leaving her with serious injuries to her leg, arm and back, authorities said.</p>
<p id="paragraph2">Authorities say the two men, ages 24 and 26, lured the teenage girl to the roof of a three-story building on Miller Avenue in East New York early Sunday.</p>
<p>They allegedly raped her and flung her off the roof after at least one of them tried to strangle her, police said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#4 New York Man Robbed, Maced, Falls Off Roof To His Death</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/promised-rooftop-tryst-leads-deadly-mace-attack-article-1.1402702">the New York Daily News</a>, a 50-year-old Brooklyn man got much more than he was bargaining for when he was lured up to the roof of a four-story building with promises of sex&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A 50-year-old Brooklyn man who fell to his death from atop a four-story building was lured onto the roof by two women who had promised him sex, police sources said Thursday.</p>
<p>Instead of showing Robert Reichl a good time, the women led him into a trap shortly after midnight on Wednesday — and stole $2,000 in cash he had been carrying.</p>
<p>Three toughs were waiting on the roof of the building on Fourth Ave. near 47th St. in Sunset Park, the sources said, and at some point the men attacked Reichl.</p>
<p>One of them, Ruben Santiago, sprayed Reichl in the face with a chemical spray believed to be mace that caused the victim to reel back, lose his balance and fall off the rooftop, the source said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5 &#8220;Malicious Fecal Distribution&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Would you defecate next to someone else&#8217;s house?  Would you do it <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/07/19/malicious-fecal-distribution-you-wont-believe-the-incredibly-vile-act-this-homeowner-caught-on-his-security-cam/">multiple times?</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-key="aansc" data-num="1">An Albuquerque, New Mexico, man was in for a vile surprise when he realized that a random woman has been defecating next to his house during her morning jogs. The bizarre and grotesque act — which has purportedly occurred at least four times — has been caught repeatedly on a security camera.</p>
<p data-key="thwua" data-num="2">The homeowner, who wishes to remain anonymous and goes by the alias “Bobby,” went to local ABC affiliate KOAT-TV with the footage in an effort to try and track the woman down — or to, at the least, shame her into stopping the unsanitary antics.</p>

<p><strong>#6 &#8220;Professional Liars&#8221; For Hire</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/17/pf/professional-liars/index.html?iid=Lead">CNN</a>, there is a company called &#8220;Paladin Deception Services&#8221; that you can actually hire to tell lies for you&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Timothy Green, a 59-year-old former private detective, claims to run a company in Forest Lake, Minn., that will lie to anyone about anything.</p>
<p>Its name is Paladin Deception Services, and it advertises its services for $54 per month.</p>
<p>Green says customers run the gamut &#8212; from cheating spouses in need of alibis to people playing hooky from work. But the real demand comes from job seekers, making up more than 60% of what he says are its 250 to 300 monthly clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can replace a supervisor with a fictitious one, alter your work history, provide you with a positive employment reputation, and give you the glowing reference that you need,&#8221; Paladin&#8217;s website states.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#7 The Violence In Chicago Just Continues To Get Worse</strong></p>
<p>The violent crime wave in Chicago is showing no signs of letting up.  In fact, just check out what happened <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/21432160-761/6-dead-17-wounded-in-shootings-since-friday-night.html">this weekend</a> between Friday night and early Sunday&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Six men have been killed and at least another 17 people &#8212; including a 6-year-old girl &#8212; have been wounded in shootings across the city since Friday night.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#8 Store Clerk Beaten With A Baseball Bat Because The Store Was Out Of Extra Large Tank Top Shirts</strong></p>
<p>It just doesn&#8217;t pay to be a store clerk in some neighborhoods these days.  Many of them only make minimum wage, and the abuse that they take from some customers <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-cops-store-clerk-beaten-with-bat-for-not-having-3x-tank-top-shirts-20130716,0,2198506.story">is terrible</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The 51-year-old clerk was behind the counter of the store when a man went into the store and asked the clerk if he had triple extra large sized tank top t-shirts, O&#8217;Brien said.</p>
<p>After the clerk told the man the store did not carry the item, the man pulled out a baseball bat and began beating the clerk, O&#8217;Brien said. After beating the clerk, the man fled with the bat.</p>
<p>Another merchant on the block said she saw the clerk run out after the man fled.</p>
<p>“He went out on the street to cry for help,’’ his body covered in blood, she said.  “It was very unfortunate, very vicious.’’</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#9 Serial Killer Murdering Women In Cleveland?</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/21/three-bodies-found-wrapped-in-plastic-in-cleveland/">Fox News</a>, law enforcement authorities in the Cleveland area are concerned that they may have uncovered the work of yet another serial killer&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The police chief of a Cleveland suburb told searchers Sunday that he believes there could be one or two more victims in addition to the three bodies found in the neighborhood earlier.</p>
<p>Police Chief Ralph Spotts told volunteers checking vacant houses to be alert for smells of rotting. He declined to elaborate on other possible victims. East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said authorities have a lot of reasons to suspect there are more, but he refused to say why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why does Cleveland seem to produce so many of these sickos?</p>
<p><strong>#10 Tee-Ball Coach Stabbed In The Neck In Front Of Kids</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>A T-ball coach was stabbed in the neck just after a youth baseball game in Hoyne Park on Sunday, allegedly by a young ballplayer&#8217;s jealous father looking for his ex&#8217;s new boyfriend.</p>

<p><strong>#11 New York Food Stamp Recipients Buying Food And Sending It Overseas?</strong></p>
<p>According to a shocking article in <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/it_on_y22owkLpsldSAjDVC9isjM">the New York Post</a>, many food stamp recipients in New York are buying food with their EBT cards and shipping it off to relatives in foreign countries&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Food stamps are paying for trans-Atlantic takeout — with New Yorkers using taxpayer-funded benefits to ship food to relatives in Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Welfare recipients are buying groceries with their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards and packing them in giant barrels for the trip overseas, The Post found.</p>
<p>The practice is so common that hundreds of 45- to 55-gallon cardboard and plastic barrels line the walls of supermarkets in almost every Caribbean corner of the city.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#12 Teens Pour Gasoline On Boy Walking Home From School And Set Him On Fire</strong></p>
<p>As I have written about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/what-in-the-world-is-wrong-with-american-kids">previously</a>, something really seems to be wrong with American kids these days.  For example, no normal kids would  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teenagers-poured-gasoline-boy-walking-home-school-set-fire-cops-article-1.1033062#ixzz2YZWm44OZ">pour gasoline</a> on a 13-year-old boy and light him on fire&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A 13-year-old boy who police say was doused with gasoline and lit on fire last week while walking home from school is recovering from first-degree burns to his face and head.</p>
<p>The boy was just two blocks from his home in Kansas City Tuesday when two teenagers began to follow him and then attacked him</p></blockquote>
<p>And remember, right now the economy is still at least somewhat stable.</p>
<p>How much worse is the decay of society going to get once the economy really starts falling to pieces?</p>
<p>Desperate people do desperate things, and once all hope of an economic recovery is gone I believe that we are going to see a huge wave of crime and civil unrest in this nation.</p>
<p>And all of this comes at a time when police forces are being cut back all over the country.  For example, as I wrote about <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-facts-about-the-fall-of-detroit-that-will-leave-you-shaking-your-head">the other day</a>, the size of the police force in Detroit has been reduced <a title="by about 40 percent" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/19/news/economy/detroit-streetlights-police/index.html?iid=Lead" target="_blank">by approximately 40 percent</a> over the past ten years.</p>
<p>You can see some photos of the ruins of Detroit <a href="http://www.weather.com/travel/modern-ruins-abandoned-detroit-photos-20130715">right here</a>.  Will hundreds of our cities eventually look like this?</p>
<p>America is changing, and not for the better.  On a very basic level, people seem to be losing a sense of love and respect for their fellow human beings.  If this continues, we will soon get to a point where many people will literally become afraid to interact with one another.</p>
<p>The thin veneer of civilization that we all take for granted is starting to disappear.  Once it is gone, it will be incredibly difficult to get back.</p>

<p><strong>#1 Automated License Plate Scanners</strong></p>
<p>All over the United States automated license plate scanners are being installed.  Sometimes they are mounted on police vehicles, and other times they are put on stationary locations like bridges and road signs.  These automated license plate scanners are collecting a staggering amount of information about the travel patterns of millions of innocent American citizens <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/07/17/license-plate-scanners-aclu-privacy/2524939/">every single day</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Police are recording and storing information on millions of license plates that aren&#8217;t related to suspected violation of the law or any known activity of interest to law enforcement, according to data collected by the American Civil Liberties Union through Freedom of Information requests in 38 states.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the Washington Post, automated license plate scanners recorded the locations of vehicle plates <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/license-plate-cameras-track-millions-of-americans/2013/07/17/40410cd0-ee47-11e2-bed3-b9b6fe264871_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost">85 million times</a> in the state of Maryland in 2012.</p>
<p>And as more of these scanners get installed around the nation, the amount of information that the government collects about the movements of our vehicles will continue to increase.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Government Workers Ordered To Spy On The &#8220;Lifestyles, Attitudes And Behaviors&#8221; Of Their Fellow Workers</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that the Obama administration has ordered federal workers <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/09/196211/linchpin-for-obamas-plan-to-predict.html#.UecKsm0pgw6">to spy on one another?</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal employees and contractors are asked to pay particular attention to the lifestyles, attitudes and behaviors – like financial troubles, odd working hours or unexplained travel – of co-workers as a way to predict whether they might do “harm to the United States.” Managers of special insider threat offices will have “regular, timely, and, if possible, electronic, access” to employees’ personnel, payroll, disciplinary and “personal contact” files, as well as records of their use of classified and unclassified computer networks, polygraph results, travel reports and financial disclosure forms.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you do not spy on your fellow workers and something goes wrong, you could lose your job or potentially even be prosecuted yourself.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Eye Scanners In Our Schools</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/11/technology/security/iris-scanning-school/index.html">CNN</a>, iris scanners are already going into schools all over the country, and soon they will be used in banks, at airports and at ATM machines&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In the next year, industry insiders say the technology will be available all over&#8211; from banks to airports. That means instead of entering your pin number, you can gain access to an ATM in a blink. Used in an airport, the system will analyze your iris as you pass through security, identifying and welcoming you by name.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will we soon live in a world where we no longer use passwords and instead use our eyeballs?&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Imagine a world where you&#8217;re no longer reliant on user names and passwords,&#8221; Eyelock CMO Anthony Antolino told CNNMoney. &#8220;If we&#8217;re going through a turnstile and you have authorization to go beyond that, it&#8217;ll open the turnstile for you, if you embed it into a tablet or PC, it will unlock your phone or your tablet or it will log you into your email account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#4 Biometric Chips In Our Passports</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that all U.S. passports contain biometric identity chips?  The following is from a recent <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/state-department-puts-biometric-chips-us-passports">CNSNews.com</a> article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the website, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 required foreigners participating in the Visa Waiver Program&#8211;which permits entry into the United States without a VISA for a limited period of time&#8211;to have these integrated circuits or chips on their passport.</p>
<p>“As a security measure, Congress has legislated that all countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program with the United States must issue passports with integrated circuits (chips), to permit storage of at least a digital image of the passport photograph for use with face recognition technology,” the website states.</p>
<p>The website also says that since 2007 the State Department has been issuing U.S. passports bearing the chips. The department did this on its own authority, and not in response to any statutory mandate enacted by Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5 All Your Financial Transactions Tracked By The Government?</strong></p>
<p>Most Americans have never even heard of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but one U.S. Senator is warning that this agency wants to keep a record <a href="http://cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/craig-bannister/govt-bureau-creating-google-earth-every-financial-transaction-senator">of all of your financial transactions</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking to create a &#8220;Google Earth&#8221; of every financial transaction of every American, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY) warned today in a Senate speech opposing confirmation of Richard Cordray as CFPB director.</p>
<p>&#8220;This bill (creating the CFPB) <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/the-bureau/" target="_blank">was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street</a>. Instead, it&#8217;s creating a Google Earth on every financial transaction. That&#8217;s right: the government will be able to see every detail of your finances. Your permission &#8211; not needed,&#8221; Sen. Enzi said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#6 Complaining About The Tap Water Makes You A Terrorist?</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever complained about the water?</p>
<p>If so, you might be a terrorist.</p>
<p>The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article <a href="http://www.storyleak.com/official-complaining-tap-water-act-of-terrorism/">by Anthony Gucciardi</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Concerned about the high levels of arsenic in your water, or perhaps the <a href="http://www.khou.com/community/A-Matter-of-Risk--Radiation-Drinking-Water-and-Deception-129145553.html">known levels</a> of radioactive contamination? Well you must be a terrorist, according to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) and Homeland Security, who consider issuing such complaints to be classified under <strong>terrorist activity</strong>.</p>
<p>It all started when Tennessee residents in Maury County recorded an exchange with the deputy director from the state’s environmental entity TDEC, who issued a warning that complaining about low quality tap water could put you in Guantanamo.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#7 DNA Databases</strong></p>
<p>The United States already has a database that contains the DNA <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130714/POLITICS03/307140045/Spread-national-DNA-databases-spawns-privacy-concerns?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|FRONTPAGE|s">of approximately 11 million criminals</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p itemprop="articleBody">The biggest database is in the United States — the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, which holds information on more than 11 million people suspected of or convicted of crimes.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">It is set to grow following a May Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right of police forces to take DNA swabs without a warrant from people who are arrested, not just those who are convicted. (Policies on DNA collection vary by state; more than half of the states and the federal government currently take DNA swabs after arrests.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course authorities will never be satisfied until they have <strong>all</strong> of our DNA.  And we are definitely moving in that direction.  The following comes from my recent article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/the-coming-national-dna-database">The Coming National DNA Database</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A national DNA database is coming.  Barack Obama has already said <a title="that he wants one" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34097.html" target="_blank">that he wants one</a>.  A major Supreme Court decision <a title="last month" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/03/supreme-court-dna-cheek-swab-rape-unsolved-crimes/2116453/" target="_blank">last month</a> paved the way for one.  The DNA of those that commit “serious crimes” is already being routinely collected all over the nation.  Some states (<a title="such as New Jersey" href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/bill_to_require_dna_collection_for_some_low-level_crimes_passes_nj_senate.html" target="_blank">such as New Jersey</a>) are now passing laws that will require DNA collection from those charged with committing “low level crimes”.  And a law that was passed under George W. Bush allows the federal government to screen the DNA of all newborn babies in the United States.  So how long will it be before we are all required to give DNA samples to the authorities?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#8 Copying Your Hard Drive At The Border</strong></p>
<p>How would you feel if you went to cross the U.S. border and officials grabbed your computer and made a copy of the hard drive?</p>
<p>As incredible as that sounds, it is happening all the time.  As I wrote about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-u-s-border-a-constitution-free-zone-where-officials-can-grab-your-computer-and-copy-your-hard-drive">recently</a>, if they do take your computer, you might not get it back <a title="for a very long time" href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/international-travelers-reviving-fourth-amendment" target="_blank">for an extended period of time</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago The Constitution Project issued a report on the issue, “Suspicionless Border Searches of Electronic Devices: Legal and Privacy Concerns with the Department of Homeland Security’s Policy.”</p>
<p>The group explained: Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “officers may detain electronic devices for significant periods of time. For CBP, detentions can be extended well beyond the minimum five-day guideline with supervisory approval. If the device is detained by ICE, the detention can last for ‘a reasonable time,’ which according to its Directive can last 30 days or more.” Neither agency sets any firm time limit.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#9 NSA Snooping</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Edward Snowden, we now know much more about NSA snooping.  Sadly, the NSA seems to want to collect every piece of data about everyone in the world that they possibly can.</p>
<p>And right now the NSA is building a place to store all of that data.  It is being constructed out in Utah, and it will be the largest data center in the history of the world.  It is going to have approximately a million square feet of storage space, it is going to cost nearly 2 billion dollars to build, and it is going to take about <a title="40 million dollars a year" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1" target="_blank">40 million dollars a year</a> just to pay for the energy needed to run it.  For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/21-facts-about-nsa-snooping-that-every-american-should-know">21 Facts About NSA Snooping That Every American Should Know</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>#10 Obama Now Has The Power To Seize Control Of The Internet?</strong></p>
<p>Why does Barack Obama keep releasing very important executive orders very late on Friday afternoons?</p>
<p>Is he trying to sneak things through that nobody will notice?</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama-seize-internet-emergency/2012/07/11/id/445083">it is being reported</a> that Barack Obama has just signed an executive order that will allow him to seize control of the Internet during a national emergency&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Another late-Friday afternoon release from the White House — this one on how agencies should communicate with the public in emergencies — has Internet privacy advocates crying foul over a possible power grab.</p>
<p>The executive order — “Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions” — was released last Friday in the late afternoon.</p></blockquote>
<p>This executive order is apparently worded so vaguely that it would allow Obama to do just about anything he wanted to as far as the Internet is concerned&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Essentially, it says the government can take control of private telecommunications technology, presumably including those used for the Internet, for government communications in an emergency.</p>
<p>“Under the Executive Order the White House has … granted the Department [of Homeland Security] the authority to seize private facilities when necessary, effectively shutting down or limiting civilian communications,” wrote the Electronic Privacy Information Center in a blog post.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you alarmed by all of this?</p>
<p>You should be.</p>
<p>Sadly, most Americans don&#8217;t even realize what is going on.  Most Americans are just working really hard to make it in this very difficult economic environment, and when they turn on their televisions the mainstream media doesn&#8217;t warn them that they are rapidly losing their freedoms and liberties.</p>
<p>Please share this article with as many people as you can.  We need people to get educated about what is happening.  What we are experiencing right now is kind of like &#8220;death by a thousand paper cuts&#8221;.  The Big Brother control grid is closing in on us in hundreds of different ways, but it is often happening so gradually that people don&#8217;t really feel it.</p>

<p>These days, you don&#8217;t have to work for a major news organization to &#8220;catch a predator&#8221;.  In fact, one father up in Michigan recently caught a 22-year-old man with condoms in his pockets coming over to have sex with his 13-year-old daughter.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Fortunately, the father intervened and captured the young man.  He even took a video of this young man <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HDWBavvW8F8">confessing what he had intended to do</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HDWBavvW8F8" height="338" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>But of course that is far from an isolated incident.  Just check out these statistics about sex offenders in the United States&#8230;</p>
<p>-There are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-registered-sex-offenders-increasing-213100455.html">747,408</a> registered sex offenders in the United States today.</p>
<p>-That number has risen by <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-registered-sex-offenders-increasing-213100455.html">23.2 percent</a> just since 2006.</p>
<p>-There are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-registered-sex-offenders-increasing-213100455.html">106,216</a> registered sex offenders in the state of California alone.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/01/23/out-of-747408-registered-sex-offenders-h">Close to nine out of every 10</a> sex crimes are committed by individuals that do not have any record of ever committing a sex crime before.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-registered-sex-offenders-increasing-213100455.html">18 percent</a> of all women in the United States say that they have been raped at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders">More than 50 percent</a> of all rapes take place within one mile of the home.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders">43 percent</a> of all rapes take place between 6 PM and midnight.</p>
<p>-Teens that are in the 16 to 19 year old age bracket are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/number-registered-sex-offenders-increasing-213100455.html">3 1/2 times more likely</a> than the general population &#8220;to be the victims of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.csom.org/pubs/mythsfacts.html">60 percent</a> of male sex abuse victims and <a href="http://www.csom.org/pubs/mythsfacts.html">80 percent</a> of female sex abuse victims &#8220;are abused by someone known to the child or the child&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Approximately 20 percent of all child sexual abuse victims in the United States <a title="are under the age of 8" href="http://www.d2l.org/site/c.4dICIJOkGcISE/b.6035035/k.8258/Prevent_Child_Sexual_Abuse.htm" target="_blank">are under the age of 8</a>.</p>
<p>-It is estimated that <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.d2l.org/site/c.4dICIJOkGcISE/b.6143427/k.38C5/Child_Sexual_Abuse_Statistics.htm" target="_blank">one out of every four</a> girls will be sexually abused before they become adults.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the time we never even hear about what is happening in the dark corners of America.  When someone does shine a light on the filth once in a while, <a title="is absolutely frightening" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/11-children-removed-sex-offender-home-found-tied-beds-article-1.1026468" target="_blank">it can be absolutely shocking</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Texas authorities said Tuesday they removed 11 children from a crowded home where a registered sex offender lives after they found eight confined in a small, dark bedroom with restraints tying some to their beds.</p>
<p>Along with the children, 10 adults were living in the one-story, 1,700-square-foot home in Dayton, about 30 miles northeast of Houston, Child Protective Services spokeswoman Gwen Carter said. One month after a raid on the house, authorities are still trying to determine how the children are related and why they were there, she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there any punishment that is too harsh for those that would treat children like that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of thing is becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>People seem to be getting sicker and more twisted with each passing year.</p>
<p>So why is all of this happening?</p>
<p>Well, a major factor is what we have been feeding into our minds&#8230;</p>
<p>-An astounding <a title="30 percent" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127201/Porn-site-Xvideos-worlds-biggest-4bn-hits-month-30-web-traffic-porn.html" target="_blank">30 percent</a> of all Internet traffic now goes to adult websites.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Article/Lifeway-Research-Pastors-say-porn-impacts-their-churches">70 percent</a> of all men in the 18 to 24 year old age bracket visit at least one adult website each month.</p>
<p>-The average high school boy spends <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-demise-of-guys-by-philip-zimbardo-2012-5">two hours</a> on adult websites every single week.</p>
<p>-Law enforcement officials estimate that about 600,000 Americans and about 65,000 Canadians <a title="are trading dirty child pictures online" href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2009/feb/09020610.html" target="_blank">are trading dirty child pictures online</a>.</p>
<p>-It has been estimated that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/12/internet-pornography-stats/">89 percent</a> of all pornography is produced in the United States.</p>
<p>When we put garbage in, we get garbage out.</p>
<p>In this kind of moral environment, some men will <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/07/09/he-was-covered-in-defecation-shocking-alleged-details-of-peeping-toms-vile-efforts-to-watch-women-from-beneath-public-toilets/">actually jump into septic tanks full of human excrement and wait there</a> hoping to get a glimpse of something&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-key="ptapt" data-num="1">Peeping Toms are always creepy in that they covertly observe victims against their will and without their knowledge. But these antics become ever more troubling when certain voyeurs take extraordinary actions to engage in and fulfill their twisted and secretive conquests. Take, for instance, the allegations against Kenneth Webster Enlow, 52, a purported peeping Tom who reportedly hid inside a septic tank and stared up at women from beneath public toilets.</p>
<p data-key="yyrlp" data-num="2"><em>Yes, you read that correctly.</em> After being discovered underneath a public restroom, Enlow has been charged with a peeping Tom complaint. He was caught in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, after a woman took her 7-year-old daughter to the bathroom at a local park.</p>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">When the got inside the bathroom, <a href="http://www.news9.com/story/22781648/tulsa-man-found-inside-septic-tank-arrested-for-peeping-tom" target="_blank">the mother and daughter duo were in for a surprise</a>. Enlow was allegedly staring up at them from inside the toilet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">Is this the way that we want to live?</p>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">Oh, but if you even mention words like &#8220;morality&#8221; and &#8220;purity&#8221; people look at you like you are crazy.</p>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">We have more than 747,000 registered sex offenders running around in this country, but we are told that there is nothing wrong with the moral compass of the American people.</p>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">So what do you think?</p>
<p data-key="wtgtt" data-num="3">What do you believe the solution to this problem is?</p>

<p>The documents that Judicial Watch was able to obtain contain some absolutely startling information.  Apparently the role of the Obama administration in these protests <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/documents-obtained-by-judicial-watch-detail-role-of-justice-department-in-organizing-trayvon-martin-protests/">was quite substantial</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>*****</p>
<p>But the involvement of the Department of Justice went far beyond just spending money and helping to organize and manage the protests.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Department of Justice was involved in setting up meetings between the NAACP and local officials, and the Department of Justice <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/documents-obtained-by-judicial-watch-detail-role-of-justice-department-in-organizing-trayvon-martin-protests/">even arranged police escorts for protesters</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-15/news/os-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-justice-departm-20120415_1_federal-workers-racial-tensions-peacekeepers"><i>Orlando Sentinel</i></a><i> </i>reported<i>, </i>“They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-15/news/os-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-justice-departm-20120415_1_federal-workers-racial-tensions-peacekeepers">the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church</a>, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents.</p>
<p>Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/judicial-watch/second-shiloh-missionary">audio recording of a “community meeting”</a> held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, <a href="http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2012/4/19/trayvon_martin_commu.html">was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders”</a> barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired.  According to the <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-15/news/os-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-justice-departm-20120415_1_federal-workers-racial-tensions-peacekeepers"><i>Orlando Sentinel</i></a>, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions is it ever acceptable for the federal government to arrange police escorts for protesters?</p>
<p>And why did the Obama administration want to help them?</p>
<p>What was the goal?</p>
<p>As a result of all of the hype that this case has been given, we now have more racial tension in the United States than we have had in a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And it is becoming apparent to everyone what could potentially happen if George Zimmerman is acquitted.  In fact, law enforcement officials are so concerned about violence in the aftermath of the verdict that they <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/08/Broward-county-sheriff-riots">have released a video</a> encouraging young people not to commit violent acts&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office released a video calling on the public not to riot in the wake of the George Zimmerman verdict, expected this week or next in Florida. The Sheriff’s Office released a statement explaining that it was “working closely with the Sanford Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies” to coordinate “a response plan in anticipation of the verdict.”</p>
<p>The video, titled “Raise Your Voice, Not Your Hands,” focuses on attempting to channel reaction into non-violent response. It depicts two youngsters, one black teenage boy, one Hispanic teenage girl. “Raise your voice!” says the girl. “And not your hands!” says the boy. “We need to stand together as one, no cuffs, no guns,” says the girl. “Let’s give violence a rest, because we can easily end up arrested,” says the boy. “I know your patience will be tested,” says the girl, and then both conclude, “but law enforcement has your back!”</p></blockquote>
<p>This never should have happened.</p>
<p>This case should never have been hyped like this.</p>
<p>Instead of being encouraged to look at each other as individuals and fellow American citizens, our politicians and the media continue to hype racial division and strife.</p>
<p>Are we ever going to learn how to love one another?</p>

<p>A lot of people think that it is the TSA that is doing this, but they are not supposed to be doing these kinds of searches.  According to <a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/01/can-tsa-copy-your-laptop-hard-drive-and.html">the official TSA blog</a>, only customs officials are authorized to search laptops and other electronic devices&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our officers might visually inspect your laptop and perform an <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/etd.shtm">explosives trace detection test</a>, but that’s it. Our officers don’t even turn computers on during inspection.</p>
<p>So where are the reports coming from? They’re coming from people who have had their laptops searched by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the Fourth Amendment, U.S. citizens are never supposed to be searched without probable cause.  But the U.S. government has decided to throw out the Fourth Amendment, and the courts have gone along with it.  So now customs officials can search anything that you bring across the border &#8211; including your computer.  The following is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_search_exception">from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), ICE-HSI Special Agents, and Coast Guard officers (E4 grade and above) who are all customs officers (those tasked with enforcing Title 19 of the United States Code) with the United States Department of Homeland Security, are permitted to search travelers and their belongings at the American border without probable cause or a warrant.  Pursuant to this authority, customs officers may generally stop and search the property of any traveler entering or exiting the United States at random, or even based largely on ethnic profiles.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you get &#8220;flagged&#8221; for some reason, you are much more likely to have your computer searched.</p>
<p>Of course this is going to make people much more hesitant to speak out against the government and it is going to have an incredibly chilling affect on our First Amendment rights, but that is probably what they want anyway.</p>
<p>One example of an individual that was &#8220;flagged&#8221; for special treatment was described in an article <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/01/09/us-customs-can-and-will-seize-laptops-and-cellphones-demand-passwords/">by Lisa Vaas</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>According to <a title="Link to Boston Globe report" href="http://bostonglobe.com/business/2012/01/08/laptop-seizures-customs-cause-thorny-legal-dispute/dnbJ2nTqirLOnsVRIBRwjP/story.html" rel="nofollow">a report</a> in Sunday&#8217;s Boston Globe, the consultant &#8211; a former MIT researcher, David House &#8211; was returning from rest and relaxation in Mexico when federal agents seized his laptop.</p>
<p>According to the Globe, the government wanted to know more about House&#8217;s connections to Bradley Manning, the US Army private <a title="Link to CNN report" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/19/us/bradley-manning-hearing/?hpt=hp_t3" rel="nofollow">accused of leaking</a> classified information to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>The seizure comes as no surprise. As Globe writer Katie Johnston notes, United States ports of entry are dubbed &#8220;Constitution-free zones&#8221; by civil liberties advocates.</p>
<p>Barring invasive techniques such as strip seizures, government agents are free to disregard Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. They don&#8217;t need reasonable suspicion or probable cause, and they can take what they like, be it laptops or smart phones.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been estimated that 5,000 laptops, cell phones, iPods and cameras are searched each year, but nobody really knows.</p>
<p>And if they do take your computer, you might not get it back <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/international-travelers-reviving-fourth-amendment">for a very long time</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago The Constitution Project issued a report on the issue, “Suspicionless Border Searches of Electronic Devices: Legal and Privacy Concerns with the Department of Homeland Security’s Policy.”</p>
<p>The group explained: Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “officers may detain electronic devices for significant periods of time. For CBP, detentions can be extended well beyond the minimum five-day guideline with supervisory approval. If the device is detained by ICE, the detention can last for ‘a reasonable time,’ which according to its Directive can last 30 days or more.” Neither agency sets any firm time limit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this upset you?</p>
<p>It should.</p>
<p>When I first heard about this, I was hesitant to believe it.</p>
<p>It just seemed too crazy to me.</p>
<p>But we live in a crazy world that is rapidly getting crazier.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has decided that any American citizen that chooses to cross the border temporarily gives up their constitutional rights, and the courts are going along with it.</p>
<p>So what should we do?</p>
<p>Well, number one, you might want to avoid going across the border if you can.</p>
<p>Secondly, you might want to consider not taking any computer with you when you do travel internationally.  Any little thing that they find can be used to put you away behind bars.</p>
<p>We are very quickly being transformed into a &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/category/big-brother">Big Brother</a>&#8221; society, and our rights are constantly being eroded.  Hopefully the American people will begin to stand up and say something about these issues, because if they don&#8217;t eventually we won&#8217;t have any privacy left at all.</p>

<p>But our justice system has got to be able to function without having to be concerned about threats of violence if the &#8220;wrong result&#8221; is reached.  George Zimmerman deserves a fair trial just like everyone else does.  If he is actually guilty of a crime, then let him be found guilty.  If he is not guilty of a crime, then let him be found not guilty.</p>
<p>This notion that he must be found guilty &#8220;for the good of society&#8221; is complete and utter nonsense.  If we start allowing public opinion and threats of violence to determine the outcome of court cases, our legal system will lose all remaining credibility.</p>
<p>And honestly, right now the case is not going very well for the prosecution at all.  It appears that there is a really good chance that George Zimmerman will be acquitted.</p>
<p>Hopefully the American people will accept whatever verdict is reached.  If he is found not guilty, it should not be interpreted as an insult to one particular race of people.  We are all Americans, and we need to start considering ourselves to be one people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, racial tensions in this country are extremely high right now, and many are warning that if George Zimmerman is found not guilty that it will unleash a wave of rioting unlike anything that we have seen in decades.  The following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.infowars.com/trayvon-supporters-threaten-riots-looting-if-zimmerman-aquitted/">by Paul Joseph Watson</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“I fully expect organized race rioting to begin in every major city to dwarf the Rodney King and the Martin Luther King riots of past decades.” warned licensed private detective and former Chicago police officer Paul Huebl, advising people to “be prepared to evacuate or put up a fight to win. You will need firearms, fire suppression equipment along with lots of food and water.”</p>
<p align="left">Columnist and former senior presidential advisor Pat Buchanan <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/05/22/what_if_zimmerman_walks_free_114228.html">cautioned last month</a> that, “The public mind has been so poisoned that an acquittal of George Zimmerman could ignite a reaction similar to that, 20 years ago, when the Simi Valley jury acquitted the LAPD cops in the Rodney King beating case.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Of course most of us are hoping that nothing like that will happen.  Most of us are hoping that cooler heads will prevail.</p>
<p align="left">But authorities are definitely concerned.  In fact, police are actually <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2013/07/cops-go-door-to-door-in-trayvon-town/">going door-to-door</a> in Sanford, Florida in an attempt to keep everyone calm&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cops are going door-to-door in an American city again, only this time at least they are knocking on doors instead of knocking them down.</p>
<p>The most recent example of a police-state presence is developing even now in Sanford, Fla., where neighborhood-watch participant George Zimmerman is on trial for murder for the death of teenager Trayvon Martin.</p>
<p>While the media has portrayed Zimmerman as white, he actually has a Hispanic heritage, and Martin was black.</p>
<p>Police say they fear the backlash from the community which could develop at the point the jury verdict is delivered. Los Angeles had days of rioting when the Rodney King verdict came down.</p>
<p>So Sanford Police Chief Cecile Smith confirmed officers are going door-to-door talking to people.</p>
<p>“Our worst fear is that we’d have people from outside the community coming in and stirring up … violence,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if Zimmerman is found not guilty, Sanford will not be the only community that could potentially see rioting.</p>
<p>The truth is that we could potentially see violence nationwide, and the mainstream media is at least partially to blame.</p>
<p>They have sensationalized this case and have stoked racial tensions for months and months.  They have turned this case into a giant media spectacle, and so now this verdict is going to be one of the most anticipated in U.S. history.</p>
<p>If the verdict does not go the way that the media and the supporters of Trayvon Martin want it to go, what is going to happen?</p>
<p>I think that we can get some clues by reading what people are saying on Twitter.  The following are some examples I found that have relatively clean language.  Many of the other examples I found were even more violent.  The threats that some of the supporters of Trayvon Martin are making are absolutely chilling&#8230;</p>

<p>What we just witnessed in Arizona was <strong>not</strong> an isolated incident.  Last week, the nation was captivated by <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/17/19007697-colorados-most-destructive-wildfire-mostly-contained-as-officials-welcome-rain?lite">the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history</a>.  And according to <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/17/19009900-california-officials-warn-fire-season-could-be-worst-in-100-years?lite">NBC News</a>, officials are saying that this could be the worst season for wildfires in the state of California in 100 years&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Southern California fire officials warned Monday that the state should take caution during a brutal fire season that projections suggest could be the worst to hit the region in a century.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a very volatile fire season,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said at a Monday afternoon news conference, who noted it could be the worst in 100 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is causing all of this?</p>
<p>Well, drought is one of the primary reasons why we are seeing so many fires.  In a <a title="previous article" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-colorado-river-the-high-plains-aquifer-and-the-entire-western-half-of-the-u-s-are-rapidly-drying-up" target="_blank">previous article</a>, I explained that scientists believe that the 20th century was the wettest century in the western half of the United States <strong>in 1000 years</strong>.  During that time, we built cities in a lot of places that historically have been very hot and very dry.</p>
<p>And now things appear to be reverting to more normal historical patterns.  And that means very dry conditions.  The past year has been the driest ever recorded for both California and New Mexico, and this past winter <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23116333">was extremely dry</a> for the entire western half of the country.</p>
<p>Sadly, the drought never seems to end.  According to the <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">U.S. Drought Monitor</a>, intensely dry conditions stretch from east Texas all the way to the California coastline right now.</p>
<p>And of course the crazy heat wave that western states are experiencing at the moment is certainly not helping things.  The high temperature in Phoenix was 115 on Sunday, and the mercury <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/southwest-braces-sizzling-temperatures-19538454#.UdIXhJy0SXw">hit 129</a> in Death Valley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the western half of the country continues to dry up <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-colorado-river-the-high-plains-aquifer-and-the-entire-western-half-of-the-u-s-are-rapidly-drying-up">at a staggering rate</a>.  Will we soon see severe water restrictions imposed in cities and towns all over the Southwest?</p>
<p>If you think this is just hype, check out what is already happening <a href="http://www.abc4.com/content/news/slc/story/Water-crisis-rocks-Lehi/Pvqr5_vLWU-Ef3yIXe23Qw.cspx">in one town in Utah</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Look around the city of Lehi and you see beautiful green lawns. You would never know they were in the middle of a water emergency. Some residents don&#8217;t even know. That&#8217;s why the city is passing out fliers to every resident, letting them know if they don&#8217;t change their ways some neighborhoods could be out of drinking water as early as tomorrow.</p>
<p>Anna Morales got one on her door yesterday and couldn&#8217;t believe how serious the situation had become.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shocked because I hadn&#8217;t heard anything prior to that,&#8221; Morales said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, even most of the people that live in these areas don&#8217;t really know what is going on.  They just assume that everything will be fine and that plenty of fresh water will always be there.</p>
<p>But as I wrote about <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/dust-bowl-conditions-are-literally-returning-to-the-western-half-of-the-united-states">recently</a>, the truth is that we are rapidly seeing conditions emerge which are reminiscent of the 1930s.  In fact, some western states are already experiencing absolutely massive dust storms that can last for up to 15 hours.  And in Nevada recently, an &#8220;apocalyptic&#8221; dust storm <a title="USA Today" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/06/11/nevada-sandstorm-pileup/2412053/" target="_blank">caused a 27 vehicle pileup</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Twenty-seven vehicles slammed into each other during a sandstorm in rural Northern Nevada, killing one person, seriously injuring several others and sapping already-thin emergency resources Monday evening, officials said.</p>
<p>Humboldt County sheriff’s dispatchers called in virtually every medical, law enforcement and fire worker in the sparsely populated area after drivers reported “near-apocalyptic” conditions on Interstate 80 three miles west of Winnemucca, according to officials at the Humboldt General Hospital.</p></blockquote>
<p>For much more on all of this, please see my recent article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/dust-bowl-conditions-are-literally-returning-to-the-western-half-of-the-united-states">Dust Bowl Conditions Are Literally Returning To The Western Half Of The United States</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>In this day and age, we like to think that our technological advancements have conquered nature, but that is most definitely not the case.</p>
<p>Our most important sources of fresh water in the western half of the nation are rapidly running dry, and the &#8220;breadbasket of America&#8221; is starting to turn back into the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p>What are we going to do when the water is gone?</p>
<p>What is going to happen to food prices if crops start failing out west year after year?</p>
<p>And what is the western half of the country going to eventually look like if wildfires continue to get even worse?</p>
<p>Scientists tell us that what we experienced last century was not normal.  For some reason, the western half of the country was unusually blessed with rain.  But now that has changed.  Things are going back to how they were before.</p>
<p>Are we going to be able to handle that?</p>

<p>If anyone still had any doubt about how stupid it would be to arm the Syrian rebels, those doubts should have been erased when a video surfaced that showed a prominent rebel fighter carving open the body of a soldier <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/world/meast/syria-eaten-heart/index.html">and eating his heart</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The ghastly video shows how barbaric the Syrian civil war can be.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph2">A man, said to be a well-known rebel fighter, carves into the body of a government soldier and cuts out his heart and liver.</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3">&#8220;I swear to God we will eat your hearts out, you soldiers of Bashar. You dogs. God is greater!&#8221; the man says. &#8220;Heroes of Baba Amr &#8230; we will take out their hearts to eat them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph4">He then puts the heart in his mouth and takes a bite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the &#8220;rebels&#8221; that we want to spend our tax dollars helping?</p>
<p>Are we insane?</p>
<p>The truth is that &#8220;moderate&#8221; groups that plan to establish a &#8220;democracy&#8221; in Syria have been completely overwhelmed by al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups in territories that are controlled by rebels.  This is something that journalists from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/19/us-syria-rebels-islamists-specialreport-idUSBRE95I0BC20130619">Reuters</a> saw very clearly during a recent trip through war-torn areas of Syria&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>During a 10-day journey through rebel-held territory in Syria, Reuters journalists found that radical Islamist units are sidelining more moderate groups that do not share the Islamists&#8217; goal of establishing a supreme religious leadership in the country.</p>
<p>The moderates, often underfunded, fragmented and chaotic, appear no match for Islamist units, which include fighters from organizations designated &#8220;terrorist&#8221; by the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/21-facts-about-nsa-snooping-that-every-american-should-know">all of the spying</a> that the NSA is doing, you would think that this shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to figure out.  Al-Qaeda and other radical jihadists groups are running the show over there.  Even the mainstream media has been openly reporting on this.  The following is from a USA Today article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/11/syria-al-qaeda-connection/2075323/">Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to al-Qaeda</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A Syrian rebel group&#8217;s April pledge of allegiance to al-Qaeda&#8217;s replacement for Osama bin Laden suggests that the terrorist group&#8217;s influence is not waning and that it may take a greater role in the Western-backed fight to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jihadists are not &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and they have no interest in &#8220;democracy&#8221;.  Instead, they have already shown exactly what they plan to do once they are in power.  They have been killing Christians everywhere they go, and in some cases they have wiped out entire Christian villages.  For example, the following is from a news report that was posted <a href="http://www.aina.org/news/20130529024056.htm">on May 29th</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Armed rebels attacked a village in Syria&#8217;s Western province of Homs and slaughtered all its Christian residents on Monday.</p>
<p>The armed rebels affiliated to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) raided the Christian-populated al-Duvair village in Reef (outskirts of) Homs near the border with Lebanon today and massacred all its civilian residents, including women and children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we really be arming such people?</p>
<p>What in the world is Barack Obama thinking?</p>
<p>Does he actually approve of the rebels dragging kids off the street and executing them for saying things against Mohammed?  Because that is <a href="http://rt.com/news/syrian-rebels-execute-teenage-boy-460/">what is actually happening</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>15-year-old Mohammad Qataa was taken hostage by the extremist group and was then summarily executed in the northern city of Aleppo on Sunday night. Pro-opposition group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) released a photo of the boy with bullet wounds in both his face and neck.</p>
<p>The SOHR said witnesses claim Qataa got into an argument at a coffee stand where he worked in the Sh’ar neighborhood of Aleppo. He was overheard saying: <i>&#8220;Even if the Prophet Mohammad comes down (from heaven), I will not become a believer.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>His words caught the attention of members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria who kidnapped Qatta. They then brought him back to the stall late on Sunday night with whiplash marks on his body.</p>
<p>According to the report published by the SOHR, one of the members of the group addressed the crowd and said: <i>“Generous citizens of Aleppo, disbelieving in God is polytheism and cursing the prophet is polytheism. Whoever curses even once will be punished like this.”</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;He then fired two bullets from an automatic rifle in view of the crowd and in front of the boy&#8217;s mother and father, and got into a car and left,&#8221;</i> the report said.</p></blockquote>
<p>How in the world can the U.S. claim to have &#8220;moral authority&#8221; if this is the kind of people that we are backing?</p>
<p>The following is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLTkMYg4zbI&amp;feature=player_embedded">video report from reporter Ben Swann</a> about these rebels.  Some of the things that he has uncovered are absolutely amazing&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZLTkMYg4zbI" height="259" width="460" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>So what is going to happen if these rebels actually take over Syria?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing they will immediately impose Sharia law on the entire nation.  The people of Syria will be under an even more tyrannical regime than before.</p>
<p>Life under such a system can be incredibly cruel.  For example, two girls in Pakistan were recently shot dead <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2351836/Smiling-sisters-shot-dead-dancing-rain-Pakistani-girls-15-16-killed-mother-making-video-stained-family-honour.html">for dancing in the rain</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Two teenage sisters have been murdered in Pakistan after they were accused of tarnishing their family&#8217;s name by making a video of themselves dancing in the rain.</p>
<p>The girls, aged 15 and 16, are seen running around in traditional dress with two other younger children outside their bungalow in the town of Chilas, in the northern region of Gilgit.</p>
<p>The sisters, named as Noor Basra and Noor Sheza, appear to break into dance and one even flashes a smile at the camera.</p>
<p>However, when the footage was circulated via mobile phones, it caused outrage in the conservative Pakistani town.</p>
<p>Last Sunday the girls were shot alongside their mother in their home by five gunmen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are we spending our tax dollars to help al-Qaeda set up such a system in Syria?</p>
<p>It is hard to put into words how stupid this all is.  Please share this article with as many people as you can.  Hopefully we can help the American people to understand how foolish it is to help these rebels.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that I am being overly pessimistic.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think that I should have more faith in the American people.</p>
<p>Well, just consider the evidence.  The following are 19 surveys which prove that a large chunk of the population is made up of totally clueless sheeple&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> One survey found that <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/">56 percent</a> of Americans believe that it is okay for the government to track &#8220;the telephone records of millions of Americans&#8221; in order to keep us safe.  Apparently those people have never heard of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> When Bush was president, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/">61 percent</a> of Democrats considered NSA surveillance to be &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;, but now that Obama is in the White House, only <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/">34 percent</a> of them consider it to be &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> <a href="http://www.rti.org/newsroom/news.cfm?obj=62BDC848-5056-B100-0C6256D7F3203F25">67 percent</a> of Americans support the use of unmanned drones in &#8220;homeland security missions&#8221; inside the United States.  What&#8217;s next?  Will there be &#8220;security robots&#8221; that stand in the corner and watch us as we eat dinner with our families?</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/29-signs-that-the-elite-are-transforming-society-into-a-total-domination-control-grid">Close to one-third</a> of all Americans would be willing to submit to a &#8220;TSA body cavity search&#8221; in order to fly.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2013/26_of_obama_supporters_view_tea_party_as_nation_s_top_terror_threat">20 percent</a> of all government workers and <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2013/26_of_obama_supporters_view_tea_party_as_nation_s_top_terror_threat">26 percent</a> of all Obama supporters consider the Tea Party to be &#8220;the biggest terror threat&#8221; that America is facing.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> <a href="http://news.discovery.com/human/health/americans-diet-weight-110104.htm">89.7 percent</a> of Americans believe that they are eating a healthy diet.  Meanwhile, approximately <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/24-facts-that-prove-that-america-is-a-nation-of-slobs">36 percent</a> of all Americans are obese.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/legacy.icmp/additional/citrix-cloud-survey-guide.pdf">29 percent</a> of Americans believe that &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; involves an actual cloud.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> One survey found that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/04/obamacare-poll-finds-42-of-americans-unaware-its-law/">42 percent</a> of all Americans are unaware that Obamacare is law.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> The average American watches <a title="28 hours" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_tel_vie-media-television-viewing" target="_blank">28 hours</a> of television every week.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> According to a survey conducted by the National Geographic Society, only <a title="37 percent" href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news_events/ed/2007/winter/features/geography.html" target="_blank">37 percent</a> of all Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 can find the nation of Iraq on a map.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/71-independence-day-dummy-seventeen-seventy-when/">Close to 25 percent</a> of all Americans do not know that the United States declared independence from Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> We are the most doped up nation in the history of the planet.  As I wrote about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/20-signs-that-the-pharmaceutical-companies-are-running-a-280-billion-money-making-scam">recently</a>, a survey conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that <a title="70 percent" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2013-rst/7543.html" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of all Americans are on at least one prescription drug.  An astounding 20 percent of all Americans are on at least five prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> According to one survey, <a title="24 percent" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">24 percent</a> of all U.S. teens that have a sexually-transmitted disease say that they still have unprotected sex.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> Approximately <a title="one out of every five" href="http://www.today.com/id/27706917/site/todayshow/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/survey-unprotected-sex-common-among-teens/#.UP3Ulmec2T5" target="_blank">one out of every five</a> teenage girls in the United States actually wants to be a teenage mother.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> As I noted <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/not-prepared-17-signs-that-most-americans-will-be-wiped-out-by-the-coming-economic-collapse">the other day</a>, <a title="48 percent" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/55-percent-of-americans-believe-that-the-government-will-take-care-of-them-if-disaster-strikes" target="_blank">48 percent</a> of all Americans do not have any emergency supplies stored up at all.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> One survey found that <a title="51 percent" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/its-official-a-majority-of-americans-would-give-up-liberty-in-order-to-be-safe-from-terrorism">51 percent</a> of all Americans agree with this statement: &#8220;it is necessary to give up some civil liberties in order to make the country safe from terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to a Bloomberg survey, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/more-than-half-of-americans-want-fed-reined-in-or-abolished.html">only 16 percent</a> of Americans believe that the Federal Reserve should be abolished.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/03/20/how-dumb-are-we.html">29 percent</a> of all Americans cannot recall the name of the vice-president of the country.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> In 2008, the American people voted to send Barack Obama to the White House.  After four years of watching everything that he did during his first term, the American people turned around and gave him another four years.</p>
<p>As a nation, we no longer seem to care much about what the U.S. Constitution actually says.  When our politicians tell us that they want to ignore large sections of the Constitution, we just shrug and go along with it.</p>
<p>And we have completely abandoned the values and the principles that this country was founded on.  Our society bears very little resemblance to 18th century America, and we like it that way.  We like to think that we have &#8220;progressed&#8221; far beyond where they were at, but the truth is that our country <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/20-examples-of-how-america-is-rapidly-going-down-the-toilet">is coming apart at the seams</a> all around us.</p>
<p>In this day and age, it is imperative that Americans learn to think for themselves.  Way too many Americans are just like sheep &#8211; they just blindly follow the herd.</p>
<p>It is time to break out of &#8220;the matrix&#8221; and to start seeing things for how they really are.  Our nation is crumbling and our leaders are taking us down a path toward oblivion.  We need to wake up our fellow Americans while there is still time.</p>

<p>But instead, the Obama administration is trying to ram amnesty for illegal immigrants through Congress as quickly as possible.  According <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/06/why-are-states-awol-from-amnesty-debate/">to the Congressional Budget Office</a>, this bill will cause unemployment to go up and wages to go down for many years.  And by rewarding illegal immigration, the federal government will just encourage much more of it.  But our politicians don&#8217;t really seem concerned with the consequences.  In fact, the Senate is going to vote on the immigration bill <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/kristol-gop-senators-should-block-immigration-monday-let-us-and-them-read-bill_736962.html">without even reading it</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on what we &#8220;owe&#8221; to those that have broken our laws by entering this country illegally, perhaps we should be talking about some of the horrible crimes that they have been committing while they have been living here.</p>
<p>For example, it recently came out that illegal immigrants have been stealing massive amounts of money from the federal government by filing fraudulent tax returns.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/irs-sent-46378040-refunds-23994-unauthorized-aliens-1-atlanta-address">one recent news report</a>, the IRS sent &#8220;23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040&#8243; to a single address in Atlanta, Georgia.  All of those fraudulent tax refunds were sent to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>How in the world did the IRS not catch that?</p>
<p>Amazingly, that was not the only address in Atlanta <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/irs-sent-46378040-refunds-23994-unauthorized-aliens-1-atlanta-address">where this kind of thing was going on</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The IRS sent 11,284 refunds worth a combined $2,164,976 to unauthorized alien workers at a second Atlanta address; 3,608 worth $2,691,448 to a third; and 2,386 worth $1,232,943 to a fourth.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some more examples from around the country where huge numbers of fraudulent tax refunds were being sent <a href="http://godfatherpolitics.com/11411/millions-in-tax-refunds-sent-to-thousands-of-illegals-at-one-address/">to a single address</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oxnard, California; 2,507 refunds worth $10,395,874.</p>
<p>Raleigh, North Carolina; 2,408 refunds worth $7,284,212.</p>
<p>Phoenix, Arizona; 2,047 refunds worth $5,558,608.</p>
<p>Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; 1,972 refunds worth $2,256,302.</p>
<p>San Jose, California; 1,942 refunds worth $5,091,027.</p>
<p>Arvin, California; 1,846 refunds worth $3,298,877.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, it has been estimated that 2 million illegal immigrants file fraudulent tax returns each year and that they are pulling in <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/millions-of-illegal-immigrants-are-using-a-massive-scam-to-get-much-bigger-tax-refunds-than-you-are">more than <strong>4 billion dollars</strong></a> in tax refunds each year that they are not entitled to.</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t the IRS do something about this?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it is because they are too busy harassing conservatives.  In fact, we have recently learned that the head of the IRS made dozens of trips to the White House during Obama&#8217;s first term, and his chief of staff actually made <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/21/top-aide-to-former-irs-chief-reportedly-logged-hundreds-white-house-visits/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fpolitics+%28Internal+-+Politics+-+Text%29">hundreds of visits</a> to the White House during Obama&#8217;s first term.</p>
<p>Instead of spending all that time plotting how to hurt their political enemies, perhaps they should have been doing something about the 2 million fraudulent tax returns that illegal immigrants are flooding the system with.</p>
<p>And illegal immigrants are responsible for an increasing percentage of violent crime in this country.  In fact, some of those that you see on the television marching for &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; are actually committing violent crimes during their free time.  For example, it turns out that a top &#8220;immigration rights activist&#8221; down in Texas was really <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/06/22/immigration-rights-activist-alleged-mesh-mask-bandit/">a serial bank robber</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hispanic leaders in North Texas are stunned that an accused serial bank robber was once one of their own. Luis Delagarza was arrested for the April robbery of a Wells Fargo Bank, but an FBI Task Force also identified him as the ‘Mesh Mask Bandit’ whose hit 19 banks since New Year’s Eve. The ‘Mesh Mask Bandit’ robbed most of his banks in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch-North Dallas area. But they are also just a few blocks away from Delagarza’s home in Farmers Branch, in a community where he made a name for himself pushing for immigration rights. His arrest has left fellow activists, such as Carlos Quintanilla, in shock.</p>
<p>“Luis Delagarza robbed banks, I guess, to deal with his demons, and that’s a sad story,” Quintanilla told CBS 11. Latinos in North Texas may remember Delagarza as an organizer of protests and marches for immigration rights, like one in Irving in 2007. “So he did some amazing things as a community leader, as a businessman, and all of that was just poisoned by him becoming a serial bank robber,” according to Quintanilla.</p></blockquote>
<p>But robbing a bank is one thing.  Attacking innocent women is much worse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the national media doesn&#8217;t like to talk about all of the rapes that illegal immigrants are committing.  The following is from a local news report about a serial rapist that turned out to be an illegal immigrant <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20130403-neighbors-relieved-after-arrest-in-lake-highlands-rapes.ece">in the Dallas area</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As investigators continue to delve into the background of the man arrested in recent rapes in the Lake Highlands area, residents began to exhale Wednesday after more than a month of fear.</p>
<p>“I have felt terrorized,” said Erin Morgan, who lives less than a mile from two of the three houses where attacks occurred. “I have lost sleep. I have added on additional layers of security to my home and thought through scenarios that I didn’t want to spend any time thinking through.”</p>
<p>Police say Cesar Benitez confessed to three attacks on women within about a quarter-mile of each other between Feb. 22 and March 19.</p></blockquote>
<p>And sometimes they don&#8217;t just attack adult women.</p>
<p>Just check out what one very sick illegal immigrant recently did <a href="http://www.alipac.us/content/illegal-alien-raped-killed-9-month-old-girl-california-1916/">over in California</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Saturday, police in Barstow arrested Jose Luis Aguilar, 36, at a Greyhound bus station after he reportedly sexually assaulted and beat his girlfriend&#8217;s baby daughter to death.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the baby&#8217;s mother, Jennifer Reedy, 31, awoke to find her daughter lying dead in her crib.</p>
<p>Aguilar was gone, as was Reedy&#8217;s car and money from her purse.</p>
<p>Police were able to find Aguilar using the GPS in his cellphone.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why is the federal government encouraging these people to come into this country?</p>
<p>We need an immigration policy that encourages productive, law abiding people to move here and that keeps violent criminals out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our current policy is allowing hordes of lawless young men to come flooding into this country, and as a result gang membership is absolutely exploding.</p>
<p>The FBI says that there are approximately <a title="1.4 million" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/1-4-million-gang-members-and-more-pour-into-the-united-states-every-single-day" target="_blank">1.4 million</a> gang members in the United States at this point, and that number has risen by an astounding <a title="40 percent" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/1-4-million-gang-members-and-more-pour-into-the-united-states-every-single-day" target="_blank">40 percent</a> just since 2009.</p>
<p>Is that a good thing for our nation?</p>
<p>And these gangs are starting to gain a stranglehold on communities all over the nation.  Just check out what is happening <a href="http://personalliberty.com/2013/02/07/mexican-drug-cartels-coming-to-a-neighborhood-near-you/">in Chicago</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the seven biggest Mexican drug trafficking organizations, the Sinaloa cartel has the biggest foothold in the U.S. Some estimates indicate that the group moves an average of one kilo of cocaine across the Nation’s border every 10 minutes. With the large amount of product coming into the United States, the cartels have set up hubs of operation here to manage distribution, and not just in border States.</p>
<p>In Chicago, where prolific violence makes headlines daily, Sinaloa has set up its American base of operations, tapping in to the heavily Mexican population of the city’s Little Village area.</p>
<p>“Chicago, with 100,000 gang members to put the dope on the street, is a logistical winner for the Sinaloa cartel,” Jack Riley, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s special agent in charge of the Chicago field division, told <i>The Washington Post</i>  after a tour through Little Village. “We have to operate now as if we’re on the Mexican border.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But this kind of thing is not just happening in major cities such as Chicago.  It is spreading very, very rapidly.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department’s National Drug Intelligence Center,  Mexican drug cartels were actively operating <a title="in 50 different U.S. cities" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/09/us/mexican-cartels-small-town-usa/index.html" target="_blank">in 50 different U.S. cities</a> in 2006.  By 2010, that number had skyrocketed <a title="to 1,286" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/09/us/mexican-cartels-small-town-usa/index.html" target="_blank">to 1,286</a>.</p>
<p>Are you starting to understand why so many people are upset about our illegal immigration crisis?</p>
<p>But many of our politicians in Washington don&#8217;t care about these things.  In particular, Democrats seem to be obsessed with the idea that legalizing illegal immigrants will gain them hordes of loyal new voters.</p>
<p>And some of these politicians are warning that if we don&#8217;t legalize the illegal immigrants that we could see massive street protests.  The following is what Senator Chuck Schumer <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/351814/immigration-reform-scare-tactics-john-fund">told CNN on Sunday</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I could see a million people on the mall in Washington — on the platform would not be the usual suspects but the leaders of business, the leaders of the Evangelical movement, the leaders of high tech as well as most Americans pressuring the House to act. I think they’re going to have to act whether they have a majority of Republicans [in the House] or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter what happens to this bill the illegal immigration crisis is not going away.  The Obama administration has already shown that it will continue <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/11-things-that-the-obama-administration-is-doing-to-promote-more-illegal-immigration">to do everything that it can</a> to promote even more illegal immigration.</p>
<p>But this is not what the American people want.  In fact, one recent survey showed that even <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/351814/immigration-reform-scare-tactics-john-fund">68 percent</a> of Hispanics in Texas support more border security.</p>
<p>We need to secure our border, and we need to make sure that all immigrants come in through the front door.  Instead, the federal government seems to want to do everything that it can to make life easier for those that have broken our laws and that are taking advantage of us.  One of my favorite columnists, <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd587.htm">Devvy Kidd</a>, recently put it this way&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Do we reward bank robbers who steal what doesn&#8217;t belong to them? Do we reward thieves who rob a gas station? Illegal aliens are no different. They lie and cheat their way into this country. They steal people&#8217;s identities ruining their credit and lives. They steal the fruits of our labor to pay for their illegal babies, education and the massive cost of clogging our judicial system with their crimes. And now we&#8217;re going to reward them?</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do you think about the immigration crisis in this country?</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> According to a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2013-rst/7543.html">70 percent</a> of Americans are on at least one prescription drug.  An astounding 20 percent of all Americans are on at least five prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> According to the CDC, approximately <a title="9 out of every 10" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db42.htm" target="_blank">9 out of every 10</a> Americans that are at least 60 years of age say that they have taken at least one prescription drug within the last month.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The 11 largest pharmaceutical companies combined to rake in <a href="http://www.alternet.org/11-major-drug-companies-raked-85-billion-last-year-and-left-many-die-who-couldnt-buy-their-pricey">approximately $85,000,000,000</a> in profits in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> During 2013, Americans will spend <a title="more than 280 billion dollars" href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/8/" target="_blank">more than 280 billion dollars</a> on prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> According to <a href="http://www.alternet.org/11-major-drug-companies-raked-85-billion-last-year-and-left-many-die-who-couldnt-buy-their-pricey">Alternet</a>, last year &#8220;11 of the 12 new-to-market drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were priced above $100,000 per-patient per-year&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The CDC says that spending on prescription drugs <a title="more than doubled" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db42.htm" target="_blank">more than doubled</a> between 1999 and 2008.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Many prescription drugs cost <a href="http://www.alternet.org/11-major-drug-companies-raked-85-billion-last-year-and-left-many-die-who-couldnt-buy-their-pricey">about twice as much</a> in the United States as they do in other countries.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> One study found that <a title="more than 20 percent" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/034278_psychiatric_drugs_adults.html" target="_blank">more than 20 percent</a> of all American adults are taking at least one drug for “psychiatric” or “behavioral” disorders.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> The percentage of women taking antidepressants in America <a title="is higher" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-medicated-americans" target="_blank">is higher</a> than in any other country in the world.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Children in the United States are <a title="three times more likely" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/depressing-facts-about-healthcare-system-2011-6#american-kids-are-three-times-as-likely-to-be-prescribed-antidepressants-than-kids-in-europe-9" target="_blank">three times more likely</a> to be prescribed antidepressants than children in Europe are.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> A shocking Government Accountability Office report discovered that <a title="approximately one-third" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/study-shows-foster-children-high-rates-prescription-psychiatric/story?id=15058380#.Ttf6hlZmlH3" target="_blank">approximately one-third</a> of all foster children in the United States are on at least one psychiatric drug.  In fact, the report found that many states seem to be doping up foster children as a matter of course.  Just check out <a title="these stunning statistics" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/study-shows-foster-children-high-rates-prescription-psychiatric/story?id=15058380#.Ttf6hlZmlH3" target="_blank">these stunning statistics</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>In Texas, foster children were 53 times more likely to be prescribed five or more psychiatric medications at the same time than non-foster children. In Massachusetts, they were 19 times more likely. In Michigan, the number was 15 times. It was 13 times in Oregon. And in Florida, foster children were nearly four times as likely to be given five or more psychotropic medications at the same time compared to non-foster children.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#12</strong> In 2010, the average teen in the U.S. was taking <a title="1.2 central nervous system drugs" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/03/maybe-we-should-blame-teenagers-for-our-health-spending-problems/" target="_blank">1.2 central nervous system drugs</a>.  Those are the kinds of drugs which treat conditions such as ADHD and depression.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> The total number of Americans taking antidepressants <a title="doubled" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-08-03-antidepressants_N.htm" target="_blank">doubled</a> between 1996 and 2005.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> All of those antidepressants don&#8217;t seem to be working too well.  The suicide rate for Americans between the ages of 35 and 64 rose <a title="by close to 30 percent" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/health/suicide-rate-rises-sharply-in-us.html?_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">by close to 30 percent</a> between 1999 and 2010.  The number of Americans that are killed by suicide now exceeds the number of Americans that die as a result of car accidents.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, <a title="36 million" href="http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs5/5140/index.htm" target="_blank">36 million</a> Americans have abused prescription drugs at some point in their lives.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> A survey conducted for the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that more than <a title="15 percent" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/prescription-drug-abuse/DS01079/METHOD=print&amp;DSECTION=all" target="_blank">15 percent</a> of all U.S. high school seniors abuse prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to the CDC, <a title="approximately three quarters of a million people a year" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-galland-md/why-medication-can-be-dan_b_643690.html" target="_blank">approximately three quarters of a million people a year</a> are rushed to emergency rooms in the United States because of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> According to the <a title="Los Angeles Times" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/17/local/la-me-drugs-epidemic-20110918/2" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>, drug deaths (mostly caused by prescription drugs) are climbing at an astounding rate….</p>
<blockquote><p>Drug fatalities more than doubled among teens and young adults between 2000 and 2008, years for which more detailed data are available. Deaths more than tripled among people aged 50 to 69, the Times analysis found. In terms of sheer numbers, the death toll is highest among people in their 40s.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#19</strong> In the United States today, prescription painkillers kill more Americans <a title="than heroin and cocaine combined" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037299_prescription_painkillers_heroin_fatalities.html" target="_blank">than heroin and cocaine combined</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> Each year, <a title="tens of billions of dollars" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_marketing" target="_blank">tens of billions of dollars</a> is spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States alone.</p>
<p>The American people deserve better than that.  Every year, the United States <a title="spends more on health care" href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c1" target="_blank">spends more on health care</a> than Japan, Germany, France, China, the U.K., Italy, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Australia combined.  In fact, if the U.S. health care system was a separate nation it would be <a title="the 6th largest economy" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/depressing-facts-about-healthcare-system-2011-6#if-our-health-care-system-were-its-own-country-it-would-be-the-sixth-largest-economy-in-the-world-29" target="_blank">the 6th largest economy</a> on the entire planet.</p>
<p>For all the money that we spend, we should be the healthiest people in the world by a wide margin.  Instead, life expectancy is higher in dozens of other countries and we have very high rates of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  For much more on the colossal failure of our health care system, please see my previous article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-a-gigantic-money-making-scam-that-is-about-to-collapse">50 Signs That The U.S. Health Care System Is A Gigantic Money Making Scam</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the pharmaceutical companies that are making billions of dollars by getting the American people addicted to their super-expensive legal drugs?</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> According to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589495-38/nsa-spying-flap-extends-to-contents-of-u.s-phone-calls/">CNET</a>, the NSA told Congress during a recent classified briefing that it does not need court authorization to listen to domestic phone calls&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, disclosed on Thursday that during a secret briefing to members of Congress, he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed &#8220;simply based on an analyst deciding that.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the NSA wants &#8220;to listen to the phone,&#8221; an analyst&#8217;s decision is sufficient, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he learned. &#8220;I was rather startled,&#8221; said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> According to U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, members of Congress learned &#8220;<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/member-of-congress-edward-snowdens-revelations-are-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg">significantly more than what is out in the media today</a>&#8221; about NSA snooping during that classified briefing.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The content of all of our phone calls is being recorded and stored.  The following is a from <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1305/01/ebo.01.html">a transcript</a> of an exchange between Erin Burnett of CNN and former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente which took place just last month&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>BURNETT: Tim, is there any way, obviously, there is a voice mail they can try to get the phone companies to give that up at this point. It&#8217;s not a voice mail. It&#8217;s just a conversation. There&#8217;s no way they actually can find out what happened, right, unless she tells them?</p>
<p>CLEMENTE: No, there is a way. We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation. It&#8217;s not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation and/or lead to questioning of her. We certainly can find that out.</p>
<p>BURNETT: So they can actually get that? People are saying, look, that is incredible.</p>
<p>CLEMENTE: No, welcome to America. All of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#4</strong> The chief technology officer at the CIA, Gus Hunt, made the following statement <a title="back in March" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/prism-leak-inside-the-controversial-us-data-surveillance-program-a-904761-2.html" target="_blank">back in March</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We fundamentally try to collect everything and hang onto it forever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5</strong> During a Senate Judiciary Oversight Committee hearing <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/17/exposure-nsa-surveillance-draw-attention-to-mueller-remark-about-real-time/">in March 2011</a>, FBI Director Robert Mueller admitted that the intelligence community has the ability to access emails &#8220;as they come in&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We put in place technological improvements relating to the capabilities of a database to pull together past emails and future ones as they come in so that it does not require an individualized search.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Back in 2007, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell told Congress that the president has the &#8220;constitutional authority&#8221; to authorize domestic spying without warrants <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/washington/02intel.html">no matter when the law says</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> The Director Of National Intelligence James Clapper recently told Congress that the NSA was not collecting any information about American citizens.  When the media confronted him about his lie, he explained that he &#8220;<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/22-nauseating-quotes-from-hypocritical-establishment-politicians-about-the-nsa-spying-scandal">responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful manner</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_print.html">is reporting</a> that the NSA has four primary data collection systems&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Two of the four collection programs, one each for telephony and the Internet, process trillions of “metadata” records for storage and analysis in systems called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/call-records-of-fewer-than-300-people-were-searched-in-2012-us-says/2013/06/15/5e611cee-d61b-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html" data-xslt="_http">MAINWAY</a> and MARINA, respectively. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/metadata-reveals-the-secrets-of-social-position-company-hierarchy-terrorist-cells/2013/06/15/5058647c-d5c1-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html" data-xslt="_http">Metadata</a> includes highly revealing information about the times, places, devices and participants in electronic communication, but not its contents. The bulk collection of telephone call records from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/administration-lawmakers-defend-nsa-program-to-collect-phone-records/2013/06/06/2a56d966-ceb9-11e2-8f6b-67f40e176f03_story.html" data-xslt="_http">Verizon Business Services</a>, disclosed this month by the British newspaper the Guardian, is one source of raw intelligence for MAINWAY.</p>
<p>The other two types of collection, which operate on a much smaller scale, are aimed at content. One of them intercepts telephone calls and routes the spoken words to a system called ­NUCLEON.</p>
<p>For Internet content, the most important source collection is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html" data-xslt="_http">PRISM project</a> reported on June 6 by The Washington Post and the Guardian. It draws from data held by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/tech-companies-urge-us-to-ease-secrecy-rules-on-national-security-probes/2013/06/11/01c489d2-d2bd-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html" data-xslt="_http">Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and other Silicon Valley giants</a>, collectively the richest depositories of personal information in history.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#9</strong> The NSA knows pretty much everything that you are doing on the Internet.  The following is a short excerpt from a recent <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/secret-prism-program-even-bigger-data-seizure-140309206.html">Yahoo article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_8_1_24_1371508783632_204">Americans who disapprove of the government reading their emails have more to worry about from a different and larger <span class="yshortcuts cs4-visible" id="lw_1371379223400_1">NSA</span> effort that snatches data as it passes through the fiber optic cables that make up the Internet&#8217;s backbone. That program, which has been known for years, copies Internet traffic as it enters and leaves the <span class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor" id="lw_1371379223400_6">United States</span>, then routes it to the NSA for analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>#10</strong> The NSA is supposed to be prohibited from spying on the Internet activity of American citizens, but it is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/secret-prism-program-even-bigger-data-seizure-140309206.html">doing it anyway</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite that prohibition, shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush secretly authorized the NSA to plug into the fiber optic cables that enter and leave the United States, knowing it would give the government unprecedented, warrantless access to Americans&#8217; private conversations.</p>
<p>Tapping into those cables allows the NSA access to monitor emails, telephone calls, video chats, websites, bank transactions and more. It takes powerful computers to decrypt, store and analyze all this information, but the information is all there, zipping by at the speed of light.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to assume everything is being collected,&#8221; said Bruce Schneier, who has been studying and writing about cryptography and computer security for two decades.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#11</strong> It has been estimated that the NSA gathers <a title="2.1 million gigabytes of data" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-about-nsa-phone-spying-2013-6#last-month-it-was-revealed-that-nsa-hackers-harvest-21-million-gigabytes-of-data-per-hour-9" target="_blank">2.1 million gigabytes of data</a> on all of us every single hour of every single day.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> In addition to collecting data on their own, a recent <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms.html">Bloomberg article</a> claims that &#8220;thousands of firms&#8221; are giving your personal information directly to the NSA.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> Companies that share their data with the NSA are exempt from prosecution due to a law that Congress passed <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589495-38/nsa-spying-flap-extends-to-contents-of-u.s-phone-calls/">back in 2008</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&amp;T and other telecommunications companies that allow the NSA to tap into their fiber links receive absolute immunity from civil liability or criminal prosecution, thanks to a law that Congress enacted in 2008 and renewed in 2012. It&#8217;s a series of amendments to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.06304:">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a>, also known as the FISA Amendments Act.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The NSA is constructing the largest data center in the world out in Utah.  It is going to have about a million square feet of storage space, it is going to cost about 2 billion dollars to build, and it is going to take about <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1">40 million dollars a year</a> just to pay for the energy needed to run the facility.  It is also being reported that it will have the capability of storing <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-surveillance-of-american-citizens-goes-far-beyond-what-you-are-being-told">5 zettabytes of data</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> The NSA has a budget of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/07/news/economy/nsa-surveillance-cost/index.html">about 10 billion dollars</a> a year.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> Overall, the United States government spends <a title="more than 80 billion dollars a year" href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/10/28/us.spy.spending/index.html" target="_blank">more than 80 billion dollars a year</a> on intelligence programs.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> According to NSA whistleblower William Binney, the NSA has a &#8220;target list&#8221; of somewhere between &#8220;<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/06/10/what-do-they-know-about-you-an-interview-with-nsa-analyst-william-binney/?print=1">500,000 to a million people</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> Binney <a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/NSA-WilliamBinneyDeclaration.pdf">also claims</a> that the NSA &#8220;has the capability to do individualized searches, similar to Google, for particular electronic communications in real time through such criteria as target addresses, locations, countries and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> According to a recent Rasmussen survey, <a title="57 percent" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2013/57_fear_government_will_use_nsa_data_to_harass_political_opponents" target="_blank">57 percent</a> of all Americans believe that the government will use the information that it collects &#8220;to harass political opponents&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> Benjamin Franklin once wrote <a title="the following" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" target="_blank">the following</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#21</strong> This is what the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>#1</strong> Why do so many members of the media have family members that work for the White House?  Is this one of the reasons why the mainstream media is so soft on Obama?  Just check out the following list which was recently compiled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/media-administration-deal-with-conflicts/2013/06/12/e6f98314-ca2e-11e2-8da7-d274bc611a47_story.html">by the Washington Post</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The list of prominent news people with close White House relations includes ABC News President <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/ben-sherwood-named-president-abc-news/story?id=12304254" data-xslt="_http">Ben Sherwood</a>, who is the brother of Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, a top national-security adviser to President Obama. His counterpart at CBS, news division president <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18564_162-7329695/david-rhodes/" data-xslt="_http">David Rhodes</a>, is the brother of Benjamin Rhodes, a key foreign-policy specialist. CNN’s deputy Washington bureau chief, <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/virginia-moseley-joins-cnn-as-dc-deputy-bureau-chief_b155326" data-xslt="_http">Virginia Moseley</a>, is married to<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/thomas-r-nides/gIQApuUfKP_topic.html" data-xslt="_http"> Tom Nides,</a> who until earlier this year was deputy secretary of state under Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>Further, White House press secretary Jay Carney’s wife is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Shipman" data-xslt="_http">Claire Shipman</a>, a veteran reporter for ABC. And NPR’s White House correspondent, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Shapiro" data-xslt="_http">Ari Shapiro</a>, is married to a lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, who joined the White House counsel’s office in April.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Why are IRS agents training <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/jeff-duncan-irs-rifle-training-92662.html?hp=f2">with AR-15 rifles</a>?  Exactly who do those IRS agents expect to be using those weapons against?</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The city of Detroit is on the verge of declaring the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, but a 41-year-old city worker is about to starting drawing a <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/only-41-ex-ficano-aide-to-start-collecting-estimated-96000-annual-pension">$96,000 annual pension</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Matt Schenk isn’t your average retiree. He’s 41, works full-time and collects $194,000 a year at the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.</p>
<p>But as soon as next month, he’ll start collecting an estimated $96,000 annual pension, courtesy of an early retirement incentive offered to Wayne County appointees.  It had no age restriction.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#4</strong> The number of sexual assaults in the U.S. military is up <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/07/military-sexual-assaults/2140835/">35 percent</a> since 2010.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> The suicide rate for Americans between the ages of 35 and 64 rose <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/health/suicide-rate-rises-sharply-in-us.html?_r=1&amp;">by close to 30 percent</a> between 1999 and 2010.  The number of Americans that are killed by suicide now exceeds the number of Americans that die as a result of car accidents.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The United States has the highest rate of obesity on the planet <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/04/25/fat-dumb-and-not-so-happy/">by far</a>.  The U.S. also has the highest rate of cancer, the highest rate of heart disease and the highest rate of diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> An illegal immigrant <a href="http://www.alipac.us/content/illegal-alien-raped-killed-9-month-old-girl-california-1916/">brutally raped and killed a 9-month-old girl</a> in Richland, Washington recently, but you won&#8217;t hear anything about it from the big mainstream news networks because it might hurt the immigration bill being pushed through Congress.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> Even though the United States has been able to fully secure the border between North Korea and South Korea for the past 60 years, U.S. Senator Check Schumer says that it would take &#8220;<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/13/schumer-years-and-years-and-years-to-secure-border">years and years and years</a>&#8221; to secure the border between the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> All over America illegal immigrants are turning pleasant communities into crime-infested cesspools.  The following is what <a href="http://justcommonsense-lostinamerica.blogspot.com/2013/06/illegals-turning-our-hometowns-into.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/MoXTa+%28Lost+in+America%29">Doug Hoagland</a> says is going on down in California&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Three decades ago, before past amnesties opened the flood gates to illegal criminals, all of the farming communities mentioned in this report were thriving small towns with low crime rates and an extremely pleasing quality of life. Now, every single one of these once fine little towns are cesspools of crime, infested with drug smugglers, anchor baby welfare trolls, where decent people can no longer walk the streets at night. According to the latest census report Selma is, like most of California&#8217;s invaded cities, 78 percent Hispanic&#8230;.and likely half of them illegal.</p>
<p>Also cited in this same report is the tragic fact that the local jails are so full these criminals must be turned out early to make way for the next fresh batch of arrestees. The Chief of Police lamented the fact that the &#8220;criminal early out&#8221; program allows the newly released criminals to go out and commit more crime.</p>
<p>During my entire 22-year Air Force career I always dreamed of retiring to my sedate and peaceful little town where I grew up. Then I came home, took a look around, saw the gangsters and the prolific graffiti that graces every street in town and decided to dwell elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#10</strong> The U.S. family is rapidly breaking down.  100 years ago, 4.52 were living in the average U.S. household, but now the average U.S. household only consists of <a href="http://www.moneychoice.org/then-vs-now/">2.59 people</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> The NSA spies on <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-rest-of-the-world-is-absolutely-disgusted-with-our-big-brother-spying-methods">virtually everything that we do</a>, but the Obama administration has banned U.S. law enforcement officials <a href="http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/061213-659753-all-intrusive-obama-terror-dragnet-excludes-mosques.htm">from spying on Islamic mosques</a> without special permission.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> Why is the University of Chicago removing pews <a href="http://www.campusreform.org/blog/?ID=4787">from an 88-year-old chapel</a> in order to make room to accommodate Islamic prayer rugs?</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> Barack Obama has decided to allow the sale of the Plan B One-Step abortion pill <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/11/plan-b-morning-after-pill?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20main-3%20Main%20trailblock:Network%20front%20-%20main%20trailblock:Position1">to girls under the age of 17</a> without a prescription.  So now young girls will be able to go to the drug store and pick up these pills at any time and their parents might not ever find out about it.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> The United States has lost <a title="more than 56,000" href="http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/" target="_blank">more than 56,000</a> manufacturing facilities since 2001, and millions upon millions of good paying jobs have been shipped out of the country.  But Barack Obama is <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/obamas-secret-treaty-which-would-push-the-deindustrialization-of-america-into-overdrive">secretly negotiating</a> even more &#8220;free trade&#8221; agreements which will destroy our economic infrastructure even further.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> The state legislature of California <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1251-1300/ab_1266_bill_20130425_amended_asm_v98.htm">has just passed a law</a> that allows boys to shower with girls in the public schools if that is more &#8220;consistent&#8221; with their gender identity.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> Why is Barack Obama <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/obama-strongly-objects-to-religious-liberty-amendment.html">strongly against</a> a measure that is being proposed in Congress that would protect the &#8220;religious liberty&#8221; of American service members?</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> In the United States today, the government treats military veterans <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/25-signs-that-military-veterans-are-being-treated-like-absolute-trash-under-the-obama-administration">like human garbage</a>.  Back in 2009, the number of veterans that had been waiting for more than a year to have their veteran benefits approved was <a title="11,000" href="http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/veterans-waiting-more-than-a-year-for-benefits-have-grown-from-11000-to-245000-under-obama-130312?news=849399" target="_blank">11,000</a>.  Today, that number has soared to <a title="245,000" href="http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/veterans-waiting-more-than-a-year-for-benefits-have-grown-from-11000-to-245000-under-obama-130312?news=849399" target="_blank">245,000</a>.  While they are waiting, the federal government is glad to provide them with &#8220;end of life&#8221; literature that helps them to determine when their lives are &#8220;<a title="no longer worth living" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204683204574358590107981718.html" target="_blank">no longer worth living</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> Today, the U.S. ranks only 51st in the world for life expectancy even though we spend far more on health care than anyone else on the planet does.  Sadly, our health care system has become <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-signs-that-the-u-s-health-care-system-is-a-gigantic-money-making-scam-that-is-about-to-collapse">a giant money making scam</a> that is not really concerned about whether most of us live or die.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> The level of government dependence in the United States is at a level <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/21-facts-about-rising-government-dependence-in-america-that-will-blow-your-mind">that we have never seen before</a>.  Back in 1960, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages was approximately <a title="10 percent" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41969508" target="_blank">10 percent</a>.  In the year 2000, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages was approximately <a title="21 percent" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41969508" target="_blank">21 percent</a>.  Today, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages is approximately <a title="35 percent" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41969508" target="_blank">35 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> The U.S. national debt is now $16,738,704,836,178.59, and it is being projected that it will increase by another <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/350983/ron-johnsons-transformative-proposal-jonathan-strong">106 trillion dollars</a> over the next 30 years.  Of course that will never happen.  The truth is that the financial system of America will totally collapse long before we ever add another 106 trillion dollars to our debt.</p>

of the millions of Americans that have been designated a threat to national security by the U.S. government?  Will you be subject to detention when martial law is imposed during a major national emergency?  As you will see below, there is actually a list that contains the names of at least 8 million Americans known as <strong>Main Core</strong> that the U.S. intelligence community has been compiling since the 1980s.  A recent article on <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/is-this-the-real-reason-for-the-government-spying-on-americans.html">Washington&#8217;s Blog</a> quoted a couple of old magazine articles that mentioned this program, and I was intrigued because I didn&#8217;t know what it was.  So I decided to look into <strong>Main Core</strong>, and what I found out was absolutely stunning &#8211; especially in light of what <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-edward-snowden-quotes-about-u-s-government-spying-that-should-send-a-chill-up-your-spine">Edward Snowden</a> has just revealed to the world.  It turns out that the U.S. government is not just gathering information on all of us.  The truth is that the U.S. government has used this information to create a list of threats to national security that the government would potentially watch, question or even detain during a national crisis.  If you have ever been publicly critical of the government, there is a very good chance that you are on that list.</p>
<p>The following is how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Core">Wikipedia</a> describes Main Core&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Main Core</strong> is the code name of a database maintained since the 1980s by the federal government of the United States. Main Core contains personal and financial data of millions of U.S. citizens believed to be threats to national security. The data, which comes from the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other sources, is collected and stored without warrants or court orders. The database&#8217;s name derives from the fact that it contains &#8220;copies of the &#8216;main core&#8217; or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was <a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf">Christopher Ketchum of Radar Magazine</a> that first reported on the existence of Main Core.  At the time, the shocking information that he revealed did not get that much attention.  That is quite a shame, because it should have sent shockwaves across the nation&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a senior government official who served with high-level security clearances in five administrations, &#8220;There exists a database of Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived &#8216;enemies of the state&#8217; almost instantaneously.&#8221; He and other sources tell Radar that the database is sometimes referred to by the code name Main Core. One knowledgeable source claims that 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially suspect. In the event of a national emergency, these people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention.</p>
<p>Of course, federal law is somewhat vague as to what might constitute a &#8220;national emergency.&#8221; Executive orders issued over the last three decades define it as a &#8220;natural disaster, military attack, [or] technological or other emergency,&#8221; while Department of Defense documents include eventualities like &#8220;riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or assemblages, [and] disorder prejudicial to public law and order.&#8221; According to one news report, even &#8220;national opposition to U.S. military invasion abroad&#8221; could be a trigger.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if that list contained 8 million names all the way back in 2008, how big might it be today?</p>
<p>That is a very frightening thing to think about.</p>
<p>Later on in 2008, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2008/07/23/new_churchcomm/">Tim Shorrock of Salon.com</a> also reported on Main Core&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dating back to the 1980s and known to government insiders as “Main Core,” the database reportedly collects and stores — without warrants or court orders — the names and detailed data of Americans considered to be threats to national security. According to several former U.S. government officials with extensive knowledge of intelligence operations, Main Core in its current incarnation apparently contains a vast amount of personal data on Americans, including NSA intercepts of bank and credit card transactions and the results of surveillance efforts by the FBI, the CIA and other agencies. One former intelligence official described Main Core as “an emergency internal security database system” designed for use by the military in the event of a national catastrophe, a suspension of the Constitution or the imposition of martial law.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why didn&#8217;t this information get more attention at the time?</p>
<p>Well, if Obama had lost the 2008 election it might have.  But Obama won in 2008 and the liberal media assumed that he would end many of the abuses that were happening under Bush.  Of course that has not happened at all.  In fact, Obama has steadily moved the police state agenda ahead aggressively.  <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-edward-snowden-quotes-about-u-s-government-spying-that-should-send-a-chill-up-your-spine">Edward Snowden</a> has just made that abundantly clear to the entire world.</p>
<p>After 2008, it is unclear exactly what happened to Main Core.  Did it expand, change names, merge with other programs or get superseded by a new program?  It appears extremely unlikely that it simply faded away.  In light of what we have just learned about NSA snooping, someone should ask our politicians some very hard questions about Main Core.  According to <a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf">Christopher Ketchum</a>, the exact kind of NSA snooping that Edward Snowden has just described was being used to feed data into the Main Core database&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A host of publicly disclosed programs, sources say, now supply data to Main Core. Most notable are the NSA domestic surveillance programs, initiated in the wake of 9/11, typically referred to in press reports as &#8220;warrantless wiretapping.&#8221; In March, a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal shed further light onto the extraordinarily invasive scope of the NSA efforts: According to the Journal, the government can now electronically monitor &#8220;huge volumes of records of domestic e-mails and Internet searches, as well as bank transfers, credit card transactions, travel, and telephone records.&#8221; Authorities employ &#8220;sophisticated software programs&#8221; to sift through the data, searching for &#8220;suspicious patterns.&#8221; In effect, the program is a mass catalog of the private lives of Americans. And it&#8217;s notable that the article hints at the possibility of programs like Main Core. &#8220;The [NSA] effort also ties into data from an ad-hoc collection of so-called black programs whose existence is undisclosed,&#8221; the Journal reported, quoting unnamed officials. &#8220;Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11 attacks but have since been given greater reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following information seems to be fair game for collection without a warrant: the e-mail addresses you send to and receive from, and the subject lines of those messages; the phone numbers you dial, the numbers that dial in to your line, and the durations of the calls; the Internet sites you visit and the keywords in your Web searches; the destinations of the airline tickets you buy; the amounts and locations of your ATM withdrawals; and the goods and services you purchase on credit cards. All of this information is archived on government supercomputers and, according to sources, also fed into the Main Core database.</p></blockquote>
<p>This stuff is absolutely chilling.</p>
<p>And there have been hints that such a list still exists today.</p>
<p>For example, the testimony of an anonymous government insider that was recently posted on <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/dhs-source-warns-world-war-about-to-break-out-will-kill-millions-of-people-must-read_06072013">shtfplan.com</a> alluded to such a list&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know all this already,” I stated. He looked at me, giving me a look like I’ve never seen, and actually pushed his finger into my chest. “You don’t know jack,” he said, “this is bigger than you can imagine, bigger than <i>anyone</i> can imagine.<strong> This administration is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> collecting names of sources, whistle blowers <i>and their families</i></span>, names of media sources and everybody they talk to and have talked to, and they already have a huge list.</strong> If you’re not working for MSNBC or CNN, you’re probably on that list. <strong>If you are a website owner with a brisk readership and a conservative bent, you’re on that list. It’s a political dissident list, not an enemy threat list</strong>,” he stated.</p></blockquote>
<p>What in the world is happening to America?</p>
<p>What in the world are we turning into?</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous article, the NSA gathers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-about-nsa-phone-spying-2013-6#last-month-it-was-revealed-that-nsa-hackers-harvest-21-million-gigabytes-of-data-per-hour-9">2.1 million gigabytes of data</a> on all of us <strong>every single hour</strong>.  The NSA is currently constructing a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2337420/Utah-Data-Center-The-million-square-foot-Utah-data-mining-facility-built-NSA.html">2 billion dollar data center</a> out in Utah to store all of this data.</p>
<p>If you are disturbed by all of this, now is the time to stand up and say something.  If this crisis blows over and people forget about all of this stuff again, the Big Brother surveillance grid that is being constructed all around us will just continue to grow and continue to become even more oppressive.</p>
<p>America is dying right in front of your eyes and time is running out.  Please stand up and be counted while you still can.</p>

every hour</a>.  This is being done even though it is a blatant violation of the U.S. Constitution.  Sadly, most Americans do not even know what the Fourth Amendment actually says.  For those that do not know, the Fourth Amendment says the following: &#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#8221;  Unfortunately, our leaders have totally abandoned the Constitution.  They seem to believe that they have the right to look through our electronic communications any time they want and that we should not complain about it.  As you will see below, workers at the NSA have even eavesdropped on very intimate conversations between soldiers serving in Iraq and their female loved ones back home.  What kind of sick person would do such a thing?  Sadly, the truth is that we have allowed ourselves to become a &#8220;Big Brother society&#8221;, and we are an utter disgrace to the millions of brave men and women who have died to defend our freedoms.</p>
<p>There was an explosion of outrage on Thursday when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order?CMP=twt_gu">the Guardian</a> reported on a leaked document that shows that the Obama administration is collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers every single day&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Security Agency is currently collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon, one of America&#8217;s largest <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Telecoms" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms">telecoms</a> providers, under a top secret court order issued in April.</p>
<p>The order, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order">requires Verizon on an &#8220;ongoing, daily basis&#8221; to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems</a>, both within the US and between the US and other countries.</p>
<p>The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House responded by calling this program &#8220;a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats&#8221;, and <span id="articleText">White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters </span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/06/us-usa-wiretaps-verizon-idUSBRE95502920130606">the following</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="articleText">&#8220;The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>So obviously the Obama administration sees nothing wrong with this at all.</p>
<p>Will some of our other &#8220;leaders&#8221; step forward and condemn this blatant violation of the U.S. Constitution?</p>
<p>Sadly, so far most of our politicians are rigorously defending the program.  Just check out how some prominent members of Congress responded to this story&#8230;</p>
<p>Senator Dianne Feinstein: &#8220;There is nothing new in this program. The fact of the matter is, that this was a routine three-month approval under seal that was leaked&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="articleText"><span id="articleText">Senator Lindsey Graham: </span></span><span id="articleText">&#8220;If we didn&#8217;t do it, we&#8217;d be crazy&#8221;<br />

<p>Senator Saxby Chambliss: &#8220;This is nothing particularly new. This has been going on for seven years under the auspices of the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) authority and every member of the United States Senate has been advised of this&#8221;</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid: &#8220;Everyone should just calm down and understand this isn&#8217;t anything that is brand new. It&#8217;s been going on for some seven years. And we&#8217;ve tried often to try to make it better, and we&#8217;ll continue to do that&#8221;</p>
<p>But the collection of phone call metadata is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The truth is that government surveillance of Americans citizens goes far beyond what you are being told.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">the Washington Post</a> has just come out with an article about a highly classified program known as PRISM that involves the federal government &#8220;tapping directly into the central servers&#8221; of nine top Internet companies&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Security Agency and the FBI are tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs that enable analysts to track a person’s movements and contacts over time.</p>
<p>The highly classified program, code-named PRISM, has not been disclosed publicly before. Its establishment in 2007 and six years of exponential growth took place beneath the surface of a roiling debate over the boundaries of surveillance and privacy. Even late last year, when critics of the foreign intelligence statute argued for changes, the only members of Congress who knew about PRISM were bound by oaths of office to hold their tongues.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what Internet companies are involved?  Most of the names will be extremely familiar to you&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The technology companies, which participate knowingly in PRISM operations, include most of the dominant global players of Silicon Valley. They are listed on a roster that bears their logos in order of entry into the program: “Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple.” PalTalk, although much smaller, has hosted significant traffic during the Arab Spring and in the ongoing Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>Dropbox , the cloud storage and synchronization service, is described as “coming soon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The capabilities of this system are apparently awesome.  Fortunately, one &#8220;career intelligence officer&#8221; was so disgusted with how our privacy rights were being violated that he decided to leak information about PRISM <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story_1.html">to the Washington Post</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Firsthand experience with these systems, and horror at their capabilities, is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type,” the officer said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another whistleblower, former NSA code breaker William Binney, has come forward with some astounding details about what is actually happening over at the NSA.  The following is from a recent <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-impact-of-nsa-domestic-spying-2013-6">Business Insider article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Binney — one of the best mathematicians and code breakers in NSA history — worked for the Defense Department&#8217;s foreign signals intelligence agency for 32 years before resigning in late 2001 because he &#8220;could not stay after the NSA began purposefully violating the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s detailed how, ever since 9/11, the NSA has run a top-secret surveillance program that amasses electronic data — phone calls, GPS information, emails, social media, banking and travel records, entire government databases — and analyzes the information &#8220;to be able to monitor what people are doing&#8221; and who they are doing it with.</p></blockquote>
<p>So exactly how much information are we talking about?</p>
<p>Overall, Binney claims that the NSA has gathered approximately <a title="National Security Agency whistleblower William Binney" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/whistleblower_the_nsa_is_lying_us" target="_blank">&#8220;20 trillion transactions&#8221;</a> involving U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>And other <a title="to one of the whistleblowers" href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/NSA-WilliamBinneyDeclaration.pdf" target="_blank">NSA whistleblowers</a> claim that the agency &#8220;has the capability to do individualized searches, similar to Google, for particular electronic communications in real time through such criteria as target addresses, locations, countries and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this is not supposed to be happening.  The NSA is not supposed to be spying on U.S. citizens and it is a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>But they are doing it.  In fact, they are gathering so much information on all of us that they needed to build a brand new data storage center out in Utah.  According to <a title="Fox News" href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/04/12/nsa-data-center-front-and-center-in-debate-over-liberty-security-and-privacy/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, it will have the capability of storing <strong>5 zettabytes</strong> of data…</p>
<blockquote><p>The NSA says the Utah Data Center is a facility for the intelligence community that will have a major focus on cyber security. The agency will neither confirm nor deny specifics. Some published reports suggest it could hold 5 zettabytes of data. (Just one zettabyte is the equivalent of about 62 billion stacked iPhones 5′s– that stretches past the moon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why do they need so much storage space?</p>
<p>Well, after you start putting the pieces together, it becomes very clear.</p>
<p>They are illegally spying on all of us, and the American people need to be told the truth.</p>
<p>But of course there are always numbskulls out there that say things like this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything to hide so I don&#8217;t care if they watch everything that I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>If you think that way, perhaps you will change your mind after you read what some NSA employees have been doing.  The following is from an article posted <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/06/nsa-spying-verizon-analysis/65963/">on theatlanticwire.com</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>And the NSA would never abuse its awesome surveillance power, right? Wrong. In 2008, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5987804&amp;page=1#.UbCL_vaDSlg" target="_blank">NSA workers told ABC News</a> that they routinely eavesdropped on phone sex between troops serving overseas and their loved ones in America. They listened in on both satellite phone calls and calls from the phone banks in Iraq&#8217;s Green Zone where soldiers call home. Former Navy Arab linguist, David Murfee Faulk described how a coworker would say, &#8220;Hey, check this out… there&#8217;s good phone sex or there&#8217;s some pillow talk, pull up this call, it&#8217;s really funny, go check it out.&#8221; Faulk explained they would gossip about the best calls during breaks. &#8220;It would be some colonel making pillow talk and we would say, &#8216;Wow, this was crazy.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We live during a time when government agencies are massively abusing their powers.  We have seen this recently with the IRS, the Justice Department and now with the NSA.</p>
<p>But so far, most Americans don&#8217;t seem too upset by all of this abuse of power.  Most Americans are so apathetic that they seem content to let the government get away with almost anything.</p>
<p>In the end, America will get the government that it deserves.  If Americans do not stand up now and speak out, it will be a signal to the government that this kind of behavior is okay and we will see even more of it.</p>
<p>So what do you think about all of the government corruption that has been exposed lately?  Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below&#8230;</p>

going on in some area of the globe.  All over the planet, we are seeing torrential rainfalls, unprecedented flooding, extreme drought, nightmarish wildfires, record setting tornadoes and very unusual blizzards.  Record high temperatures and record low temperatures are set so frequently now that nobody really seems to even notice anymore.  So exactly what in the world is going on here?  Why does our weather seem to be going absolutely crazy?  Perhaps even more important &#8211; can we expect our weather patterns to become even more erratic?  Some meteorologists are suggesting that these unusual weather events are just an &#8220;anomaly&#8221; and that things will get back to normal soon.  But what if they don&#8217;t?</p>
<p>I noted that natural disasters seem to be increasing in both frequency and severity in my recent article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/are-we-entering-the-worst-period-for-natural-disasters-in-u-s-history">Are We Entering The Worst Period For Natural Disasters In U.S. History?</a>&#8220;  But it isn&#8217;t just the ground under our feet that seems to be becoming more unstable.  The weather patterns that we all take for granted and that society depends upon seem to be rapidly changing.</p>
<p>The following are 22 signs that global weather patterns are going absolutely crazy&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right now, central Europe is experiencing the worst flooding that it has seen <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/06/03/europe-floods-060313.html">in at least 70 years</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> On Memorial Day weekend, a vicious winter storm dumped <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/feet-snow-upstate-ny-memorial-weekend-19262830#.Ua6Ep5wQNhI">up to 36 inches of snow</a> on parts of upstate New York.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Back in mid-May, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2324803/UK-weather-Its-middle-May-Two-inches-snow-months-rainfall-day-65mph-winds-hit-Britain.html">on one single day</a> some parts of the UK had a couple of inches of snow, some parts of the UK had a month&#8217;s worth of rainfall on a single day, and some parts of the UK were hammered by winds of up to 65 miles per hour.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The month of April was so cold across the northern United States that one meteorologist said that it was &#8220;<a href="http://theextinctionprotocol.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/spring-disappears-from-northern-hemisphere-the-winter-that-wont-end/">like something out of the Twilight Zone</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>April has been a freakishly cold month across much of the northern USA, bringing misery to millions of sun-starved and winter-weary residents from the Rockies to the Midwest. “The weather map … looks like something out of The Twilight Zone,” Minneapolis meteorologist Paul Douglas of WeatherNation TV wrote on his blog last week. Record cold and snow has been reported in dozens of cities, with the worst of the chill in the Rockies, upper Midwest and northern Plains. Several baseball games have been snowed out in both Denver and Minneapolis. Cities such as Rapid City, S.D.; Duluth, Minn.; and Boulder, Colo., have all endured their snowiest month ever recorded. (In all three locations, weather records go back more than 100 years.) In fact, more than 1,100 snowfall records and 3,400 cold records have been set across the nation so far in April, according to the National Climatic Data Center.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> This year Saskatchewan had the coolest spring that it has experienced <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2013/04/22/sk-cold-spring-1304.html">in 100 years</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Moscow just experienced the snowiest winter that it has seen <a href="http://rt.com/news/snowiest-moscow-winter-century-470/">in 100 years</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Snow is falling in Russia in places where it should not be falling this time of the year.  On Sunday, residents of Kemerovo were stunned to see that <a href="http://rt.com/news/siberia-june-snow-kemerovo-130/">a thin layer of snow</a> had fallen on their city overnight.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> This spring, there was a <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/47154/20130405/#.UWFrbJNHJ9l">record amount of ice</a> on the Baltic Sea due to very cold weather&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since record keeping began in the sixties, we&#8217;ve never encountered anything like this before,&#8221; ice breaker Ulf Gulldne told the local newspaper Örnsköldsviks Allehanda.</p>
<p>On March 29th, 176,000 square kilometers of the Baltic Sea was covered in ice, a record for the time of year. On a map, it means about half of the central and northern parts are frozen over. Far north, the ice is both thick and difficult to break through.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9.</strong> The city of Anchorage, Alaska <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/51929453/ns/local_news-anchorage_ak/#.Ua6DapwQNhI">set a record</a> for the longest snow season that it has ever experienced this year.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> In February, hail the size of &#8220;boulders&#8221; pounded one poor city <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2271147/Nine-people-killed-freak-hailstorm-rains-massive-boulders-Indian-villages.html">in southern India</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hailstones the size of boulders have rained down on villages in southern India.</p>
<p>At least nine people were killed when the violent weather hit several villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The hailstorm which lasted for almost 20 minutes, destroyed crops, houses and live stock, causing devastating financial implications for residents.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>11.</strong> The tornado that touched down near Oklahoma City on Friday was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/06/04/okla-tornado-record-ef5/2388759/">the widest tornado ever recorded</a>.  It was an EF5 tornado that was 2.6 miles wide at one point with winds of up to 295 miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> The tornado that did such devastating damage to Moore, Oklahoma recently was about 2 miles wide and it sat on the ground for an astounding <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/are-we-entering-the-worst-period-for-natural-disasters-in-u-s-history">40 minutes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> During the month of February, Peru, Chile and Bolivia were all hit by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21399408">unprecedented flooding</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> At the end of May, <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/25/18493585-third-victim-found-dead-as-flood-warnings-remain-in-sodden-san-antonio?lite">more than a foot of rainfall</a> in 24 hours caused nightmarish flooding in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> A few weeks ago, unusual levels of rainfall caused the Mississippi River to rise <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-midwest-floodwaters-cities-140/">to near record levels</a>.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> This year the state of Georgia experienced the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/27/extreme-weather-swings_n_3165594.html">wettest February</a> ever recorded.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> Chicago just had the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/27/extreme-weather-swings_n_3165594.html">wettest April</a> ever recorded.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> Scientists are projecting that the nightmarish drought that is taking place in the western half of the United States will &#8220;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/21/nation/la-na-noaa-drought-20130222">intensify</a>&#8221; this year.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> Overall, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/25/drought-trees-midwest/1858413/">hundreds of thousands of trees</a> died throughout the United States during 2012 due to horrible drought conditions.</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> This past January, part of Australia experienced record setting high temperatures that were <a href="http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/22543/53/">absolutely unprecedented</a>.  Keep in mind that the following temperatures are in Celsius&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sydney endured its hottest ever day on Friday, with records smashed across the city and thousands of people suffering from the heat.  The mercury topped 45.8 at Sydney&#8217;s Observatory Hill at 2.55pm, breaking the previous record set in 1939 by half a degree. The city&#8217;s highest temperature was a scorching 46.5 degrees, recorded in Penrith at 2.15pm, while Camden, Richmond and Sydney Airport all reached 46.4 degrees.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>21.</strong> Over the weekend, extremely dry conditions were making it difficult for firefighters to battle a very intense wildfire in California that had already burned <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334604/Powerhouse-Fire-Three-wildfires-sweep-Los-Angeles-New-Mexico-burning-tens-thousands-acres.html">more than 20,000 acres</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>By Sunday night, the Powerhouse Fire around the Angeles National Forest in Southern California engulfed about 22,400 acres, endangering some 1,000 homes in the Lake Elizabeth and Lake Hughes area.</p>
<p>Nearly 2,100 firefighters struggled to contain the fire, which more than tripled in size from Saturday to Sunday. Nearly 3,000 people have been evacuated and the blaze has already destroyed at least six homes by Sunday night.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>22.</strong> About <a href="http://rt.com/usa/bee-pollination-disaster-food-959/">30 percent</a> of all honeybees are dying each year in the United States, and nobody seems to know exactly why this is happening.  If this continues, it threatens to absolutely cripple U.S. agriculture&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>US honey bees have been dying by the tens of millions, with annual death rates of about 30 percent. With fewer bees to pollinate fruits and vegetables each year, &#8216;beemageddon&#8217; may soon cause the collapse of the agriculture industry.</p>
<p>Honey bees pollinate more than 100 US crops, including apples, zucchinis, avocados and plums, that are worth more than $200 billion a year. Since 2006, about 10 million bee hives at an average value of $200 each have been lost in what scientists call the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), according to a new report by the US Department of Agriculture.</p></blockquote>
<p>We certainly don&#8217;t need any more bad news about our agriculture.  Global food supplies are currently at their lowest level <a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/scientists-plan-to-feed-maggots-to-the-cows-and-chickens-that-we-eat">in 40 years</a>, and most people in the general public are absolutely clueless about what is going on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our weather has not just been unusual for the past few months.  This is a trend that has been developing for quite some time.</p>
<p>For example, the planet experienced some truly unusual weather last winter.  The following comes from a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/science/earth/extreme-weather-grows-in-frequency-and-intensity-around-world.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times article</a> from last January&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Around the world, extreme has become the new commonplace.</p>
<p>Especially lately. China is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/09/china-cold/1820089/">enduring its coldest winter</a> in nearly 30 years. Brazil is in the grip of a dreadful heat spell. Eastern Russia is so freezing — minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and counting — that the traffic lights recently stopped working in the city of Yakutsk.</p>
<p>Bush fires are <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/world/asia/record-heat-fuels-widespread-fires-in-australia.html">raging across Australia</a>, fueled by a record-shattering heat wave. Pakistan was inundated by unexpected <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/29/world/asia/pakistan-floods/index.html">flooding in September</a>. A vicious storm bringing rain, snow and floods just struck the Middle East. And in the United States, scientists confirmed this week what people could have figured out simply by going outside: <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/science/earth/2012-was-hottest-year-ever-in-us.html">last year was the hottest</a> since records began.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, &#8220;extreme has become the new commonplace&#8221; as far as our weather is concerned.</p>
<p>So will our weather get back to &#8220;normal&#8221; soon or are even greater changes ahead?</p>
<p>And what in the world is causing all of this?</p>

<p>The latest generation of electronic tattoos is quite remarkable.  They are called &#8220;Biostamps&#8221;, and they were originally developed for medical purposes.  However, as a recent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2333203/Moto-X-Motorola-reveals-plans-ink-pills-replace-ALL-passwords.html">Daily Mail article</a> detailed, Motorola believes that these Biostamps could potentially replace passwords and make the Internet a much more secure place&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>MC10 originally designed the tattoos, called Biostamps, to help medical teams measure the health of their patients either remotely, or without the need for large expensive machinery.</p>
<p>Motorola claims that the circuits, which also contain antennae and built-in sensors, could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>The mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner&#8217;s identity and log them in to accounts automatically.</p>
<p>This would prevent thieves and other people from being able to access a phone, or individual apps on the device, if it is stolen or lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>These Biostamps are extremely, extremely thin.  As I mentioned above, they are actually thinner than a human hair.  The following description of Biostamps was taken from a <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2013/02/skin-printed-electrodes/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Wired Magazine</a> article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The development takes wearable technology to the extreme, designed as a non-invasive diagnostic sensor that could be used to measure hydration, activity, and even infant temperature. It bonds to the skin, somewhat like a temporary tattoo, flexing and bending in sync with your skin the way you wish a Band-Aid would. How? Researchers at the University of Illinois, Dalian University of Technology in China, and the University of California at San Diego made it really, really small.</p>
<p>With a thickness of 0.8 micrometers at the widest — around one-thousandth the diameter of a human hair — the thin mesh of silicon actually nestles in to the grooves and creases in your skin, even the ones too small to see. Being small helps, but it’s also important that the silicon is laid out in a serpentine pattern and bonded to a soft rubber substrate, allowing the stiff material to flex, a little bit like an accordion.</p></blockquote>
<p>But why would such technology be needed on the Internet?</p>
<p>After all, don&#8217;t our passwords work just fine?</p>
<p>Actually, we are rapidly getting to the point where passwords are a joke.  Hackers are becoming so sophisticated that they can crack even very long passwords <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2333203/Moto-X-Motorola-reveals-plans-ink-pills-replace-ALL-passwords.html">with ease</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A team of hackers, commissioned by technology website Ars Technica, recently managed to crack more than 14,800 supposedly random passwords &#8211; from a list of 16,449 &#8211; as part of a hacking experiment.</p>
<p>The success rate for each hacker ranged from 62 percent to 90 percent, and the hacker who cracked 90 percent of hashed passwords did so in less than an hour using a computer cluster.</p>
<p>The hackers also managed to crack 16-character passwords including &#8216;qeadzcwrsfxv1331&#8242;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Were you alarmed when you read that?</p>
<p>I know that I was.</p>
<p>Obviously we need a better system.</p>
<p>But personally I never plan to wear an electronic tattoo.  That crosses the line in a big way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of technology is going to be heavily pushed in the years ahead.  According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/sensor-tattoos/">Wired magazine</a>, even the U.S. military is devoting resources to developing electronic tattoo technology&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In its ongoing quest to measure every aspect of U.S. troops’ physiology, Pentagon researchers are looking to develop a durable, unobtrusive device that can track the body’s physical response to stress. Military scientists believe that using the device — preferably a tattoo — to track heart-rate, temperature or bio-electric response during various training situations will help them crack the code of combat fatigue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another significant trend is the development of electronic devices that we can control directly with our minds.  In the past, such technology was the stuff of science fiction novels, but now even <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/disruptions-no-words-no-gestures-just-your-brain-as-a-control-pad/?ref=business">the New York Times</a> is writing about it&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Soon, we might interact with our smartphones and computers simply by using our minds. In a couple of years, we could be turning on the lights at home just by thinking about it, or sending an e-mail from our smartphone without even pulling the device from our pocket. Farther into the future, your robot assistant will appear by your side with a glass of lemonade simply because it knows you are thirsty.</p>
<p>Researchers in Samsung’s Emerging Technology Lab are testing tablets that can be controlled by your brain, using a cap that resembles a ski hat studded with monitoring electrodes, the MIT Technology Review, the science and technology journal of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <a title="The article." href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/513861/samsung-demos-a-tablet-controlled-by-your-brain/">reported this month</a>.</p>
<p>The technology, often called a brain computer interface, was conceived to enable people with paralysis and other disabilities to interact with computers or control robotic arms, all by simply thinking about such actions. Before long, these technologies could well be in consumer electronics, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what if you could combine the two trends discussed above?</p>
<p>What if an electronic tattoo would allow you to operate your tablet computer, send an email, fly a drone or even &#8220;speak&#8221; telepathically using only your mind?</p>
<p>Actually, researchers are already working on such technologies.  The following comes from a recent article <a href="http://txchnologist.com/post/43496630304/temporary-tattoos-could-make-electronic-telepathy">by Charles Q. Choi</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But brain implants are invasive technologies, probably of use only to people in medical need of them. Instead, electrical engineer <a href="http://coleman.ucsd.edu/lab-research/"><span>Todd Coleman at the University of California at San Diego</span></a> is devising noninvasive means of controlling machines via the mind, techniques virtually everyone might be able to use.</p>
<p>His team is developing wireless flexible electronics one can apply on the forehead just like temporary tattoos to read brain activity.</p>
<p>“We want something we can use in the coffee shop to have fun,” Coleman says.</p>
<p>The devices are less than 100 microns thick, the average diameter of a human hair. They consist of circuitry embedded in a layer or rubbery polyester that allow them to stretch, bend and wrinkle. They are barely visible when placed on skin, making them easy to conceal from others.</p>
<p>The devices can detect electrical signals linked with brain waves, and incorporate solar cells for power and antennas that allow them to communicate wirelessly or receive energy. Other elements can be added as well, like thermal sensors to monitor skin temperature and light detectors to analyze blood oxygen levels.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read that rest of that article <a href="http://txchnologist.com/post/43496630304/temporary-tattoos-could-make-electronic-telepathy">right here</a>.  Some of the things that our scientists are working on right now are absolutely mind blowing.</p>
<p>We live at a time when technology is advancing at an exponential rate.  Sometimes I have a very hard time believing some of the technological advances that I am writing about.  The world is going to look very, very different ten years from now.</p>
<p>But will the changes be for the better?</p>
<p>Technology is advancing at a faster pace than we have ever seen before, but at the same time the world is becoming an increasingly unstable place.</p>
<p>Could technology that enables us to interact with our environment using our minds actually be turned around and used to control our minds by a future tyrannical government?</p>
<p>Could technology that helps us identify one another on the Internet someday be used to brand us all like cattle and force all of humanity into a dark system of control and enslavement?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that such a dystopian society can never exist in our modern world.  Freedoms and liberties are being taken away from people <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/category/big-brother">all over the globe right now</a> even though things are still relatively stable.</p>
<p>So what is going to happen when the world goes crazy someday and the planet is absolutely ravaged by economic collapse, pandemics, crime, rioting, natural disasters and war?</p>
<p>That is something to think about.</p>

height="300" /></a>Why does the Obama administration treat our military veterans like human garbage?  Every year on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, Barack Obama and our other politicians make very nice speeches, but the truth about how they feel about our veterans can be seen in how they are treated every single day.  In the United States today, there are well over half a million veterans that have been waiting for at least 125 days to have their benefit claims processed.  Many of them will ultimately have their claims sent back or denied just so a government employee somewhere can get a bigger bonus.  Meanwhile, conditions at VA facilities all over the country are absolutely abysmal, and many veterans have to wait more than half a year just to get an appointment at one of those facilities.  Once you start looking into how this country really treats military veterans, it becomes easier to understand why 22 military veterans commit suicide in America every single day.  Our vets have a higher rate of unemployment, a higher rate of poverty, a higher rate of homelessness, a higher rate of depression and a higher rate of divorce then the general population.  It is a crying shame.  One of the ways that any society is judged is by how it treats military veterans, and the truth is that America has failed miserably.  This has been particularly true since Barack Obama has been in the White House.</p>
<p>The following are 25 signs that military veterans are being treated like absolute trash under the Obama administration&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The average claim for veteran benefits takes <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/2012/07/17/veterans-administration-is-hopelessly-broken/">more than half a year</a> to be processed.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The Department of Veterans Affairs has a backlog of <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-05-28/veteran-disability/55250092/1">more than half a million</a> overdue claims for benefits that are at least 125 days old.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> In 2009, the number of veterans that had been waiting for more than a year to have their benefits approved was <a href="http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/veterans-waiting-more-than-a-year-for-benefits-have-grown-from-11000-to-245000-under-obama-130312?news=849399">11,000</a>.  Today, that number has soared to <a href="http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/veterans-waiting-more-than-a-year-for-benefits-have-grown-from-11000-to-245000-under-obama-130312?news=849399">245,000</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Thousands upon thousands of military veterans that are waiting for their claims to be processed are dealing with <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-05-28/veteran-disability/55250092/1">absolutely horrible injuries</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="inside-copy">Of those who have sought VA care:</p>
<p class="inside-copy">• More than 1,600 of them lost a limb; many others lost fingers or toes.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">• At least 156 are blind, and thousands of others have impaired vision.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">• More than 177,000 have hearing loss, and more than 350,000 report tinnitus — noise or ringing in the ears.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">• Thousands are disfigured, as many as 200 of them so badly that they may need face transplants. One-quarter of battlefield injuries requiring evacuation included wounds to the face or jaw, one study found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> At one VA hospital in Wisconsin, one military veteran with a broken jaw that was seeking treatment still had not had his jaw fixed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=t-ns8FeydZc">after a month and a half</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Today, it takes military vets an average <a title="of seven months" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=132383&amp;page=1" target="_blank">of seven months</a> to get an appointment at a VA facility.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Many VA facilities are in absolutely horrific condition.  A while back, ABC News conducted an investigation of conditions at VA facilities across the United States.  What ABC News discovered was absolutely shocking.  The following are just a few of the things that they found <a title="during the course of their investigation" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132383&amp;page=1" target="_blank">during the course of their investigation</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>*Bathrooms filthy with what appeared to be human excrement</p>
<p>*Dirty linens from some patients mixed in with clean supplies</p>
<p>*Examining tables that had dried blood and medications still on them</p>
<p>*Equipment used to sterilize surgical instruments that had broken down</p>
<p>*Some patients were forced to beg for food and water</p>
<p>*Veterans that were neglected so badly that they developed horrific bedsores and dangerous infections</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> As I have written about <a title="previously" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/memorial-day-shocker-how-the-u-s-government-really-handles-veterans-benefits-deny-deny-deny-until-they-die">previously</a>, applying for veteran benefits is extremely complicated, and VA employees are actually <strong>paid bonuses</strong> for denying claims&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is that we have made it extremely difficult for our military veterans to claim the benefits that we have promised them.  Vets have to fill out an absurdly complicated 23 page application and if they make even one small mistake their applications can be stonewalled for years.  The U.S. Veterans Administration actually has a policy under which they pay large bonuses to employees that meet certain application processing goals.  This explains why <a title="approximately&amp;nbsp;70% of the claims" href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Roth/laurie216.htm" target="_blank">approximately 70% of the claims</a> submitted to the Veterans Administration are refused or sent back to be redone.  In fact, using the Freedom of Information Act, <a title="one local NBC station" href="http://www2.wsls.com/sls/news/local/article/va_workers_get_bonuses_deny_veterans/48926/" target="_blank">one local NBC station</a> was able to learn that $250,000 was paid in bonuses to VA employees who work inside the Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, Virginia in just one year alone.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Large numbers of military veterans that legitimately should be getting benefits are having their claims denied by the federal government.  Just check out the following example from a <a title="Veterans Today article" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/11/30/banks-targeting-military-families-for-illegal-foreclosures/" target="_blank">Veterans Today article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In one case, we found a veteran with 40 percent of his brain removed found to be healthy and employable.  He was also missing his right arm.  The physician who examined him over looked the arm and failed to note the cognitive degeneration the traumatic brain injury had caused.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> 10.</strong> Last year, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/20/more-than-85000-veterans-treated-last-year-over-alleged-military-sex-abuse/?test=latestnews">more than 85,000 military veterans</a> were treated for sexual abuse that they suffered while serving in the military.  40 percent of them were men.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> According to a recent Defense Department survey, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/military-suffers-wave-of-gay-sex-assaults/">approximately 14,000 men</a> in the U.S. military were sexually assaulted by other men during 2012.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-grapples-with-sex-crimes-by-military-recruiters/2013/05/12/d082ec1c-b97e-11e2-bd07-b6e0e6152528_story.html?hpid=z2">the Washington Post</a>, there is an epidemic of sexual assaults being committed by military recruiters.  The Pentagon is pledging to do something about the problem&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The secretary has made it clear that we will spare no effort to rid our military of sexual abuse,” said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary. “The fact that there have been problems of sexual abuse during the recruiting process is simply intolerable.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>13.</strong> The number of active members of the U.S. military that are killing themselves <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/military-suicides-rising-combat-eases-article-1.1091776?localLinksEnabled=false">now exceeds</a> the number that are dying on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Since the beginning of the Iraq War, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/039473_psychiatric_drugs_soldiers_suicides.html">twice as many</a> members of the Texas National Guard have killed themselves as have been killed in combat.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> According to <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/02/01/study-22-military-veterans-commit-suicide-every-day/">one recent study</a>, 22 military veterans kill themselves in the United States every single day.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> At this point, combat veterans account for <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/039473_psychiatric_drugs_soldiers_suicides.html">about 20 percent</a> of all suicides in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> The unemployment rate for military veterans is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/finance/occupy-wall-street/archives/2011/11/the_vets_job_crisis_is_worse_than_you_think.html">significantly higher</a> than for the population as a whole.  This is especially true for younger veterans.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> On any given night, approximately <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/857-the-economic-abuse-of-veterans-in-america">200,000</a> military veterans are homeless in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> All over America, monuments that honor military veterans are crumbling and falling apart.  For much more on this, please see <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/honoring-veterans-as-monuments-decay-funds-dry-up-1.222867">this article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> Under the Obama administration, many military veterans have had to pay to have their medals shipped to them.  For example, one soldier actually had to pay a 21 dollar shipping fee to get his Purple Heart.  The following is from <a title="the Huffington Post" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/06/rob-dickerson-purple-heart-c-o-d_n_919379.html" target="_blank">the Huffington Post</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>War comes with an incalculable human cost. And apparently a shipping fee of about $21.</p>
<p>Retired Sgt. Major Rob Dickerson says that’s the price he was forced to pay when his Purple Heart — the medal issued to soldiers wounded in action — arrived at his door, C.O.D.</p>
<p>Instead of being awarded the military honor in a formal ceremony, the vet with 29 years in the service was handed his award, and a shipping invoice, by a FedEx deliveryman outside his Sioux Falls, S.D., home.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>21.</strong> In some areas of the country the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs <a title="has been caught" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/29/houston-veterans-claim-censorship-prayers-ban-on-god-and-jesus/" target="_blank">has been caught</a> banning the words &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;Jesus&#8221; during funeral services for veterans.</p>
<p><strong>22.</strong> Today, the federal government provides &#8220;end of life&#8221; literature to veterans that helps them to determine when their lives are &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204683204574358590107981718.html">no longer worth living</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your Life, Your Choices&#8221; presents end-of-life choices in a way aimed at steering users toward predetermined conclusions, much like a political &#8220;push poll.&#8221; For example, a worksheet on page 21 lists various scenarios and asks users to then decide whether their own life would be &#8220;not worth living.&#8221;</p>
<p>The circumstances listed include ones common among the elderly and disabled: living in a nursing home, being in a wheelchair and not being able to &#8220;shake the blues.&#8221; There is a section which provocatively asks, &#8220;Have you ever heard anyone say, &#8216;If I&#8217;m a vegetable, pull the plug&#8217;?&#8221; There also are guilt-inducing scenarios such as &#8220;I can no longer contribute to my family&#8217;s well being,&#8221; &#8220;I am a severe financial burden on my family&#8221; and that the vet&#8217;s situation &#8220;causes severe emotional burden for my family.&#8221;When the government can steer vulnerable individuals to conclude for themselves that life is not worth living, who needs a death panel?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>23.</strong> One study discovered that approximately <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/why-does-the-u-s-government-treat-military-veterans-like-human-garbage">one-third</a> of all military veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq were officially determined to be mentally ill by government officials.</p>
<p><strong>24.</strong> All over America, &#8220;mental illness&#8221; is being used as a reason <a href="http://www.infowars.com/veteran-declared-mentally-defective-has-guns-seized/">to take guns away from military veterans</a>.</p>
<p><strong>25.</strong> The federal government is increasingly labeling military veterans as &#8220;potential domestic terrorists&#8221; if they express viewpoints that are critical of the government.  The following is from a recent article <a href="http://www.opednews.com/populum/pagem.php?f=Operation-Vigilant-Eagle--by-John-Whitehead-130522-54.html">by John Whitehead</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Making matters worse, thanks to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123992665198727459.html" target="" rel="nofollow">Operation Vigilant Eagle</a>, a program launched by the Department of Homeland Security in 2009, military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are also being characterized as extremists and potential domestic terrorist threats because they may be &#8220;disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war.&#8221; As a result, these servicemen and women&#8211;many of whom are decorated&#8211;are finding themselves under surveillance, threatened with incarceration or involuntary commitment, or arrested, all for daring to voice their concerns about the alarming state of our union and the erosion of our freedoms.</p>
<p>An important point to consider, however, is that the government is not merely targeting individuals who are voicing their discontent so much as it is locking up <i>individuals trained in military warfare</i> who are voicing feelings of discontent. Under the guise of mental-health treatment and with the complicity of government psychiatrists and  law-enforcement officials, these veterans are increasingly being portrayed as ticking time bombs in need of intervention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you upset yet?</p>
<p>You should be.</p>
<p>The way that the federal government is treating military veterans is absolutely shameful.</p>
<p>Do you have a story that illustrates how our military veterans are being abused?</p>

Most Americans assume that the U.S. military is so vastly superior to everyone else that no other nation would ever dream of fighting a full-scale war against us.  Unfortunately, that assumption is dead wrong.  In recent years, the once mammoth technological gap between the U.S. military and the Chinese military has been closing at a frightening pace.  China has been accomplishing this by brazenly stealing our technology and hacking into our computer systems.  The Pentagon and the Obama administration know all about this, but they don&#8217;t do anything about it.  Perhaps the fact that China owns about a trillion dollars of our national debt has something to do with that.  In any event, today China has the largest military in the world and the second largest military budget in the world.  They have stolen plans for our most advanced jets, helicopters, ships and missile systems.  It is estimated that stealing our technology has saved China about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/confidential-report-lists-us-weapons-system-designs-compromised-by-chinese-cyberspies/2013/05/27/a42c3e1c-c2dd-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story_2.html">25 years</a> of research and development.  In addition, China is rapidly developing a new generation of strategic weapons that could potentially enable it to actually win a future war against the United States.  At one time such a notion would have been unthinkable, but as you will see below, the next war with China could go very badly for the United States.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/confidential-report-lists-us-weapons-system-designs-compromised-by-chinese-cyberspies/2013/05/27/a42c3e1c-c2dd-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story_2.html">Washington Post</a> is reporting on a confidential report that was prepared for the Pentagon, and what this report says about the extent of Chinese cyber espionage is absolutely startling.  Will China know ALL of our secrets at some point?  The following is a brief excerpt from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/confidential-report-lists-us-weapons-system-designs-compromised-by-chinese-cyberspies/2013/05/27/a42c3e1c-c2dd-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story.html">the Washington Post article</a> about the theft of our military technology by China.  It turns out that Chinese hackers have gotten their hands on plans for almost all of the new cutting edge weapons systems that we have been developing&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the weapons form the backbone of the Pentagon’s regional missile defense for Asia, Europe and the Persian Gulf. The designs included those for the advanced Patriot missile system, known as PAC-3; an Army system for shooting down ballistic missiles, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD; and the Navy’s Aegis ballistic-missile defense system.</p>
<p>Also identified in the report are vital combat aircraft and ships, including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ship, which is designed to patrol waters close to shore.</p>
<p>Also on the list is the most expensive weapons system ever built — the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is on track to cost about $1.4 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>One military expert that the Washington Post showed the report to was absolutely stunned&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s staggering,” said Mark Stokes, executive director of the Project 2049 Institute, a think tank that focuses on Asia security issues. “These are all very critical weapons systems, critical to our national security. When I hear this in totality, it’s breathtaking.”</p>
<p>The experts said the cybertheft creates three major problems. First, access to advanced U.S. designs gives China an immediate operational edge that could be exploited in a conflict. Second, it accelerates China’s acquisition of advanced military technology and saves billions in development costs. And third, the U.S. designs can be used to benefit China’s own defense industry. There are long-standing suspicions that China’s theft of designs for the F-35 fighter allowed Beijing to develop its version much faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t just hackers that the U.S. military needs to be concerned about.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Chinese are stealing secrets from us any way that they can.</p>
<p>For example, the Chinese use attractive young women to seduce our defense contractors.  In fact, as <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/19/us-defense-contractor-arrested-passing-secrets-chi/">the Washington Times</a> recently reported, one 59-year-old American man was recently charged with passing very sensitive secrets to a 27-year-old Chinese &#8220;honeypot&#8221; that he was seeing&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A U.S. defense contractor who works in intelligence at the military’s <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pacific-command/">Pacific Command</a> in Hawaii has been charged with passing classified national security information to a 27-year-old Chinese woman he was dating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-pierce-bishop/">Benjamin Pierce Bishop</a>, 59, is accused of sending the woman an email in May with information on Pacom’s war plans, nuclear weapons and U.S. relations with international partners, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Honolulu and unsealed Monday.</p>
<p>The complaint goes on to allege that <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-pierce-bishop/">Mr. Bishop</a> told the woman over the telephone in September about the deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons and about the ability of the U.S. to detect other nations’ short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another way that China is gaining a strategic advantage over the U.S. is by getting the U.S. military to become increasingly dependent upon them.  According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2013/05/05/a-modest-proposal-lets-outsource-the-entire-u-s-defense-effort-to-china/?partner=yahootix">Forbes</a>, now the U.S. military is even leasing a Chinese satellite for communications purposes&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>American dependence on China grows by the day. The latest <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-29/pentagon-using-china-satellite-for-u-s-africa-command.html">news</a> is that the United States has been reduced to leasing a Chinese satellite to handle communications with U.S. military bases in Africa. Surprising, isn’t it? The nation that launched the world’s first communications satellite (I remember it well – it was called Telstar) has so lost its manufacturing mojo that it has to rely on its most formidable military adversary to provide the hardware for some of its most sensitive communications. This at a time when underlying unemployment rates among U.S. manufacturing workers remain at near-depression levels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that crazy?</p>
<p>And a recent Senate report discovered that many of our most advanced weapons systems <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/counterfeit-parts-from-china-raise-grave-concerns-for-both-us-companies-and-national-security-2012-6">are absolutely riddled</a> with counterfeit Chinese parts&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent Senate report, titled <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Counterfeit%20Electronic%20Parts.pdf"><em>Inquiry Into Counterfeit Electronic Parts In The Department Of Defense Supply Chain</em></a>, &#8220;uncovered overwhelming evidence of large numbers of counterfeit parts making their way into critical defense systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investigation found <strong>1,800 cases of counterfeit electron</strong><strong>ic parts involving over one million suspect parts in 2009-10 alone</strong>, thereby exposing &#8220;a defense supply chain that relies on hundreds of unveiled independent distributors to supply electronic parts for some of our most sensitive systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report <a href="http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/senate-armed-services-committee-releases-report_on-counterfeit-electronic-parts">concluded</a>, among other things, that <strong>China is the &#8220;dominant source&#8221; of counterfeit products that enter the Do</strong><strong>D supply chain</strong>, that the Chinese government does little to stop it and that the DoD doesn&#8217;t know the &#8220;scope and impact&#8221; of these parts on critical defense systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who in the world would be stupid enough to allow one of their greatest strategic enemies to supply large numbers of parts for key weapons systems?</p>
<p>Apparently we are that stupid.</p>
<p>Things are particularly bad when it comes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2013/05/05/a-modest-proposal-lets-outsource-the-entire-u-s-defense-effort-to-china/?partner=yahootix">to semiconductors</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator John McCain commented: &#8220;We can’t tolerate the risk of a ballistic missile interceptor failing to hit its target, a helicopter pilot unable to fire his missiles, or any other mission failure because of a counterfeit part.&#8221; Calling the issue &#8220;a ticking time bomb,&#8221; Brian Toohey, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, commented: &#8220;The catastrophic failure risk inherently found in counterfeit semiconductors places our citizens and military personnel in unreasonable peril.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be bad enough if we just had to worry about counterfeit parts failing.  But what if China has a way to shut some of those parts down in the event of a conflict?  What if some of those parts contain &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; computer chips or malware?</p>
<p>That may sound crazy, but unfortunately Trojan Horse chips can be extremely difficult to detect.  The following is from a recent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2013/05/05/a-modest-proposal-lets-outsource-the-entire-u-s-defense-effort-to-china/?partner=yahootix">Forbes article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Defense Science Board pointed out, Trojan Horse circuitry is almost impossible to detect even with the most rigorous analysis. This is particularly so if a saboteur can accomplish matching subversions in both software and relevant hardware.</p></blockquote>
<p>And as I mentioned above, China is rapidly developing a vast array of new strategic weapons which may enable it to actually win the next war with the United States.</p>
<p>For example, China has been developing <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-08-25/news/33385310_1_dongfeng-41-dummy-warheads-missiles">a new generation</a> of inter-continental and submarine-launched nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-comprehensive-guide-to-chinas-military-tech-2012-6#the-ju-lang-2-delivers-an-immense-payload-up-to-8700-miles-away-19">submarine-launched missiles</a> are of particular concern&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ju Lang-2 intercontinental missile is the second generation of Chinese submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a closely held secret, and details are sketchy. If it lives up to what public military intelligence says it is, it&#8217;s a huge get for China, especially with their new sub fleet.</p>
<p>The missile is believed to have a range of 8,000 km, and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you remember a few years ago when a Chinese sub fired a missile <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2010/11/230425/">from just off the west coast of the United States</a>?</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t know that the sub was there.  If that missile had been fired at Los Angeles it would have been destroyed long before we could have ever responded.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t think that a first strike by either China or Russia is inconceivable.  As I have written about previously, the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal has already been reduced <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/barack-obama-it-is-a-moral-obligation-to-neuter-america">by about 95 percent</a>, and Obama seems absolutely determined to whittle it down even more.  In fact, there has been talk that the Obama administration ultimately wants to reduce our arsenal down <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/barack-obama-it-is-a-moral-obligation-to-neuter-america">to just 300 warheads</a>.  If Russia or China knows exactly where those warheads are, it would be very easy to take them out in less than 10 minutes with a submarine-based first strike.</p>
<p>And China has also reportedly been developing very sophisticated EMP weapons.  The following is from a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/u-s-ships-threatened-by-secret-china-emps/">WND</a> report&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2011, it was first revealed that China was developing EMP weapons to be used against U.S. aircraft carriers in any future conflict, especially over Taiwan, according to a 2005 National Ground Intelligence Center study.</p>
<p>That center study said the Chinese were developing a family, or “assassin’s mace” of EMP and high-powered microwave, or HPM, weapons to be used by a technologically inferior force such as China’s, against U.S. military forces.</p>
<p>The once secret but now declassified study pointed out that the Chinese could detonate an EMP weapon some 30 to 40 kilometers over Taiwan or – by inference – a U.S. carrier strike group – and destroy the electronics capability on which U.S. network-centric strategy depends.</p></blockquote>
<p>But an EMP weapon does not have to be a high-altitude weapon that affects a large area.  Smaller scale EMP weapons could take out a wave of fighter jets or a carrier fleet.</p>
<p>In a future conflict with China, we could see U.S. planes falling out of the sky or great naval vessels sitting dead in the water after being hit with EMP blasts.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t China our friend?</p>
<p>That is what most Americans and most American politicians seem to believe.  They seem to think that China is our &#8220;buddy&#8221; and &#8220;trading partner&#8221; and that we will never have a military conflict with China.</p>
<p>But that is NOT how the Chinese see things.</p>
<p>The Chinese regard the United States as their greatest strategic threat and as an enemy that needs to be vanquished.</p>
<p>That is why they are constantly spying on us, hacking into our computers and stealing our technology.</p>
<p>That is why they are feverishly building up their military and preparing for a future war with America.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Do you believe that war with China is in our future?</p>
<p>If so, do you think that we will win?</p>
