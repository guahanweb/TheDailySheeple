        <!-- <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129267" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rogers-warns.jpg" alt="rogers-warns" width="0" height="0" /></p>
<p>Legendary investor Jim Rogers understands a thing or two about how economies and globally intertwined financial markets work. He&#8217;s visited 116 countries and holds a Guinness Book world record. And during the 1970&#8217;s he made his billions as the rest of the world fell into recession. So when Jim speaks, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to listen what he&#8217;s saying.</p>
<p>Based on what&#8217;s happening around the world, in his latest interview with <strong><a href="http://www.futuremoneytrends.com/" target="_blank">Future Money Trends</a></strong> Rogers says we are closer to a serious crisis now than we&#8217;ve ever been and urges people to prepare for what comes next.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You should be worried and you should be prepared&#8230; Everybody should be worried and prepared&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The markets are telling us something is wrong.</strong></p></blockquote>

<em><strong>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdZZr2KEwI" target="_blank">Watch Full Interview At Youtube</a>)</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually the market is just going to say to these central bankers, &#8216;enough is enough &#8211; we don&#8217;t want your garbage paper anymore.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then we&#8217;re going to have the real crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2015 in the United States, twice as many stocks were down as were up&#8230; They were disguised by the fact that a few big companies went up all the time &#8211; you know the names, Amazon, Microsoft &#8211; those stocks went up. And <strong>they hid the fact that the markets were deteriorating underneath.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This year everything is going down&#8230;nearly everything. So, we know that the market knows and the market is telling us it&#8217;s getting closer and closer.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-129260" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/crystal-ball.png" alt="crystal ball" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>When it comes to whatever social media platform we use on a regular basis, most of us take it for granted that these websites are spying on us in some capacity. Granted, many social media users don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t care, but everyone else at least implicitly agrees that in exchange for using these website for free, their posts will be data mined for information that can be used to target them with ads.</p>
<p>However, the personal information and opinions that we put out on social media doesn&#8217;t just provide commercial opportunities for advertisers. It&#8217;s a veritable goldmine for governments as well. Everything that people used to keep to themselves in previous generations, is now willingly shouted into the internet abyss for all to hear. Social media users often feel free to share their most controversial, subversive, and inflammatory thoughts on a platform that could reach millions of people. It&#8217;s kind of crazy when you think about it, but it&#8217;s the world we live in today.</p>
<p>Governments of course, love this. People say things on the internet, that in years past would require a warrant to discover. Law enforcement would have to get permission from a judge to tap someone&#8217;s phone, or search their house for diaries and letters that would give them a damning insight into that person&#8217;s psychology and intentions. Now we just give it away for free.</p>
<p>Obviously, this makes it very easy for the government to identify individual threats. Somebody can talk about overthrowing the government on social media, and either they&#8217;ll be reported or some NSA algorithm will pick them up, and add their comments to a threat matrix. But social media has the potential to give the government so much more. It can also give them an insight into the collective desires of the masses.</p>
<p>A new study was recently conducted by Arizona State University, Texas A&amp;M, and Yahoo, which discovered that with the right algorithm, <a href="http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/02/military-funded-study-predicts-when-youll-protest-twitter/126156/" target="_blank">you can predict with 70% accuracy</a>, the probability that any given Twitter user is going post something that is part of a protest. They could use this information to predict a protest movement in the real world, as well as how big it will eventually become.</p>
<blockquote><p>The researchers collected 2,686 posts related to the Nigerian general election that took place between February and April of last year, an election that was marred by political violence in the form of the Boko Haram insurgency and that was beset by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/04/25/nigeria-presidential-election-marred-fraud-violence" target="_blank">accusations</a> of voting irregularities. So what predicts when someone begins protesting on Twitter? It’s not your personal history so much as your Twitter history of interacting with people who are part of that movement.</p>
<p>“The interaction we study is how users mention each other,” researchers Suhas Ranganath and Fred Morstatter wrote to <em>Defense One </em>in an email. “In the model, the probability of the future post expressing protest increases if: 1) The post mentioning the user is related to the protest. 2) The author of the post mentioning the user is interested in the protest. We dynamically learn [or teach] the model by testing how each of the previous status messages of the given user are affected by the recent posts mentioning him. We then use the model to predict the likelihood of the user expressing protest in his next post.”</p>
<p>Their accuracy threshold of 70 percent is because what might seem completely unpredictable is in fact part of a pattern, albeit one that’s incredibly complex. The researchers employed <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Eperes/bmbook.pdf" target="_blank">Brownian</a> motion theory to design the formula, a theory that usually is employed to track the movement of particles, as well as model stock market fluctuations and other highly complicated systems. “Brownian Motion for fluid particles models change in the direction of the particle movement  on collision with other particles. We take each ‘particle’ as a social media user. We relate collision with other particles, other users mentioning him, and the change in direction to change of the user’s inclination to express protest in his next post. We then use the models of Brownian motion to relate the two quantities. We mainly employ this to model the dynamic change in user behavior resulting from interactions over time,” Suhas told <em>Defense One.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I might add that it wasn&#8217;t just some university or a private company that decided to fund this study. The Office of Naval Research chipped in as well, so clearly the government is interested in this sort of thing.</p>
<p>For them, social media is a powerful tool. The deeply personal opinions that you might shout into the internet, gives the government the power of prognostication. And as computer technology advances, they will be able to do better than 70%. They&#8217;ll be able to look at the information you post on social media, compare that to what everyone else is saying, and they&#8217;ll be able to predict wars, protests, and revolutions long before they occur. And that&#8217;s an incredibly dangerous power for any government to have.

<p>When Agenda 21 is finally implemented in full, and tens of millions of Americans are crammed into the cities like cattle, where do you think they&#8217;re all going to live? How are we going to squeeze all these people into the already crowded urban cores? Don&#8217;t worry, there will be plenty of housing for the masses once the micro apartments are built.</p>
<p>Several cities are already trying this out. They&#8217;ve lifted building code restrictions to allow developers to build the tiniest apartments you can imagine. The most famous of these is the <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/02/18/designs-for-micro-apartments-prove-less-is-more/" target="_blank">Carmel Place development in New York City</a>, which contains 55 units that range in size from 265 to 360 square feet, and cost between $2,650 and $3,150 per month.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9yvOTyMZyo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>They make it look so classy, but in reality it&#8217;s a giant ripoff.  Like everything else in life, the bigger an apartment is, the cheaper it is per square foot. This is just an attempt by developers to milk every penny out of their tenants. Instead of saving money by sharing an apartment with other people, our corporate overlords want us to us pay exorbitant prices to live alone in tiny apartments.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re presented as chic and novel, because they&#8217;re currently catering to upper middle class singles. But once the impoverished masses and forced to migrate to the cities (<a href="http://mic.com/articles/58399/china-is-forcing-250-million-rural-dwellers-to-relocate#.e63vQ4szp" target="_blank">as China has done in recent years</a>) they&#8217;ll start to look more and more like prison cells.

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124291" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/syrian-refugee-wikimedia.png" alt="syrian refugee wikimedia" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Most governments pride themselves on their ability to keep track of their citizens. They want to know where you live and where you work, they litter the streets with surveillance cameras, and they want us all to carry IDs at all times. So what does it say when a country like Germany loses track of thousands of people? Since governments are normally really good at controlling and surveilling their populations, it means that they&#8217;re quickly <em>losing</em> control of their country.</p>
<p>The German government recently admitted that they don&#8217;t know the whereabouts of <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/26/german-government-admits-they-have-lost-one-in-ten-migrants/" target="_blank">over 130,000 refugees</a>. That is 13% of 1.1 million recent arrivals to Germany. When they first arrived, they simply didn&#8217;t go to the reception centers that they had been directed to. The government knows when and where they first arrived, but these people never registered for asylum.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just what the German government will admit to. The number <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/22/german-government-cant-account-for-600000-migrants-could-have-travel-across-europe/" target="_blank">could be as high as 600,000</a>, most of whom have likely moved on to other EU nations. And this situation is only going to get worse from here. The refugees are pouring into Europe at <a href="http://www.infowars.com/europe-collapsing-as-migrant-invasion-doubles/" target="_blank">twice the rate they were last year</a>, and 2015 saw twice as many asylum applications <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644518/Migrant-crisis-EU-asylum-applications-doubles-to-1-2million" target="_blank">as the year before that</a>. If Europe doesn&#8217;t shutter its borders completely, then they won&#8217;t be very European for much longer.

<p>This one is making headlines all over the place in the last 24 hours, and it reeks of the same agenda-driven psyop gusto that&#8217;s behind the flat Earth theory: something over-the-top put in place and widely publicized as much as possible to make all conspiracy theorists (aka critical thinkers who do not automatically believe everything they are told by the government and mainstream media outlets without questioning said events) look insane to the rest of the general public, thus discrediting them, all conspiracy theories, and the entire alternative media movement.</p>
<p>See the video that started it for yourself:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPpH-_k3PQU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Now check this out, via <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/conspiracy-theorists-claim-katy-perry-jonbenet-ramsey-article-1.2545246" target="_blank">NYDaily News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ramsey — a 6-year-old girl from Boulder, Colo. — was found strangled to death in the basement of her family home in 1996, but to this day, the case remains unsolved. For some reason, this has fueled speculation that the child beauty queen’s death was actually faked, and she instead grew up to be famed pop-star Katy Perry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/FPpH-_k3PQU" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> of the conspiracy was posted back in December 2014 by Dave Johnson, <strong>but recently started getting attention. [emphasis mine]<br />
</strong></p>
<p>“JonBenét Ramsey did not die, nobody died, nobody got hurt,” Johnson says in the video. &#8220;But she was sacrificed: That sacrifice was in name only, and that sacrifice was to get something, and that something was to become a star.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The more important question is, why is a conspiracy video that&#8217;s over a year old being splashed around in headlines everywhere today? Why did it &#8220;recently&#8221; start &#8220;getting&#8221; widespread mainstream media &#8220;attention&#8221;?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a real conspiracy for you.</p>
<p>Is something about to happen that would require a huge lambasting and discrediting of so-called &#8220;conspiracy theorists&#8221; and the alternative media <em>beforehand</em> so that when it does, people can say, &#8220;Yeah, but those guys are a bunch of whack jobs, they&#8217;re the same people who believe Katy Perry is really JonBenét Ramsey&#8221;&#8230;?</p>

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mariashock2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-129231" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mariashock2.jpg" alt="mariashock2" width="515" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>Twice in recent days, former Mexican president Vicente Fox has declared to the media that neither he, nor Mexico will be paying for the &#8220;f*cking wall&#8221; that Donald Trump has vowed to build along the U.S.-Mexico border should he become president.</p>
<p>Trump has said not only will the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/so-how-high-will-donald-trumps-wall-be-an-investigation/" target="_blank">potentially 55-foot-high wall</a> be built, but he&#8217;s going to make Mexico pay for it.</p>
<p>Skip ahead in the first video below to around the 9:30 mark. Fox tells reporter Maria Bartiromo, <strong>&#8220;I have to say, we&#8217;re not, I am not going to pay for that f*cking wall. I am not.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9rwybihPM0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Fox was dead serious. He said it again in a different interview just to make sure everyone heard him right.</p>

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bangkokfireballx.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-120820" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bangkokfireballx.jpg" alt="bangkokfireballx" width="500" height="356" /></a></p>
<p>A space rock calculated to be as wide as a two story building is tall which exploded with the equivalent of 13,000 tons of TNT entering Earth&#8217;s atmosphere was <em>missed</em> by NASA on February 6th. Completely.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that NASA has a whole entire <a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/" target="_blank">program specifically dedicated</a> to spotting potentially dangerous space rocks entering the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>NASA made the announcement after the fact, but the agency was itself informed of the event by <em>another</em> agency, which many have speculated is the military. (Other guesses are the NSA, which spies on everything everywhere, including space.)</p>
<p>How sad is that?</p>
<p>The government isn&#8217;t telling anyone exactly what technology was used to hone in on this rock entering the atmosphere, but astronomer and Slate science writer Phil Plait noted that there three possible ways:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can think of three ways to detect a big fireball in this case: Satellite observations, which would image them directly; seismic monitors, which can detect the explosion as the sound wave from the blast moves through the ground; and atmospheric microphones, which can detect the long-wavelength infrasound from an event. This may have been detected by any combination of these (though since it was over the open ocean, seismic monitors seen unlikely).”</p></blockquote>
<p>The fireball fell over the Atlantic ocean in a place we are told is 600 miles away from the nearest inhabited place, but had it taken a slightly different path, it would&#8217;ve come down over a major city, rattling people&#8217;s windows and scared the hell out of everyone with absolutely no warning whatsoever from our so-called space agency.</p>
<p>NASA tries to pretend they have everything space-related monitored and under control at all times with all these comets and asteroids we&#8217;ve been seeing lately (which, is it just me, seems to be on an uptick?), but as stories like this continue to come out, it doesn&#8217;t leave anyone with the impression they actually do.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves: NASA can make all the new programs they want, but it is pretty clear that the public wouldn&#8217;t be warned in the event of a real Earth-leveling asteroid hurling toward the planet.</p>
<p>Guess we should all watch out for the military moving into their underground bunkers on that one.</p>

<p>As sad as this story is, it also might restore your faith in humanity a little.</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Kiera Larsen died Monday while saving the lives of two toddlers from an out-of-control SUV that was barreling down on them.</p>
<p>A 1999 Mercedes parked on a sloping driveway near where the girl and toddlers were playing somehow went into neutral and took off backwards down the slope.</p>
<p>Kiera&#8217;s stepmom had run inside for just a second to grab a car charger. Kiera risked her life pushing the toddlers out of the way but was hit by the SUV and later succumbed to her injuries at the hospital.</p>
<p><em>“A child died heroically, I mean if you think about it, she sacrificed herself for another small child,&#8221;</em> California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Pearlstein said.</p>
<p>How the vehicle went into neutral is currently under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/wxqrrqec." target="_blank">GoFundMe</a> account set up to pay for the family&#8217;s funeral expenses has already raised well over $77,000.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lindseygraham.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-113621" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lindseygraham.jpg" alt="lindseygraham" width="500" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>A lot of people have made jokes about this speech, but watch again. I don&#8217;t even think Graham was joking for most of it. He might have been drunk, but even the supposed &#8220;jokes&#8221; he makes here actually appear pretty serious if you look at him.</p>
<p>Graham just basically admitted the establishment GOP has gone down in total flames and this country is screwed as people are about to elect &#8220;the most dishonest woman in the country&#8221; as president.</p>
<p>Watch the highlights:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKDbt6pmC-g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>Here are some of Lindsey’s greatest hits (via <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/26/lindsey_graham_jokes_about_the_murder_of_ted_cruz_and_finally_admits_the_gop_has_gone_batsht_crazy_in_hilariously_honest_speech/" target="_blank">Salon</a>):</p>
<p>On his failed campaign</p>
<p>Noting that the supposed “moderate” in the race, John Kasich, just joked about “women leaving their kitchens” and “nice guy” Ben Carson once “tried to kill his cousin and hit his mother in the head with a hammer,” Graham asked, “How did I lose to these guys?”</p>
<p>On Ted Cruz</p>
<p>“If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you,” Graham said, referencing the Tea Party senator’s unpopular reputation with his colleagues.</p>
<p>“A good Republican would defend Ted Cruz after tonight,” Graham remarked, before adding, “That ain’t happening.”</p>
<p>“I was asked the hardest question in my political life: Do you agree with Donald Trump that Ted Cruz is the biggest liar in politics?” he said. “Too close to call.”</p>
<p>And Graham did not hold back from jumping on the Cruz birther bandwagon for a night.</p>
<p>“I will say that our Canadian is better than your Kenyan,” he quipped.</p>
<p>“I know exactly when Ted is going to drop out of the race. March 12 — that’s Canadian week in Myrtle Beach, when all of our Canadian friends get 10 percent off.”</p>
<p>On Marco Rubio</p>
<p>Calling the freshman Florida senator “the boy wonder,” Graham joked that “I’m not saying he would change his positions, but he would change his positions.”</p>
<p>“The Secret Service’s main job if he’s president is to keep him hydrated.”</p>
<p>On Donald Trump</p>
<p>I’m “literally running out of adjectives” to impugn Trump, Graham joked to reporters.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he understands what makes America great.”</p>
<p>On Republican Party</p>
<p>“The most dishonest person in America is a woman who is about to be president. How could that be? My party has gone bats*** crazy,” Graham joked to raucous laughter in the room Thursday night.</p>
<p>“I think we’re likely to lose the last best chance in a long time to win the White House. I think that the consequences of us losing are going to be monumental for domestic and foreign policy, and the [Supreme Court].”</p></blockquote>
<p>He also says women have come a long way, as the most dishonest person in the country is a woman&#8230; that Americans are about to elect as president.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supposed to be comedy, but it&#8217;s actually horrifying if you think about it for longer than five seconds together.

<p>Did you know that a huge asteroid is scheduled to make a “close shave” with our planet on March 7th?</p>
<p>This asteroid is known as “2013 TX68″, and it is estimated to be anywhere from 80 to 170 feet in length.  Most news reports are saying that it is 100 feet long.  Scientists are telling us that they are not certain exactly how close this giant space rock will come, and that is rather unsettling.  They say that it could come within roughly 1/20th the distance from the Earth to the moon, or that it could pass by millions of miles away.  Because the orbit of this huge asteroid is unpredictable, they tell us that they don’t really know what will happen, but they insist that it will not hit us.  If it does pass us at 1/20th the distance from the Earth to the moon, that would be about half as far up as many of our communications satellites.  That would be <strong>incredibly</strong> close, and many are wondering what may happen if our scientists are just <strong>slightly</strong> off in their calculations.</p>
<p>This asteroid will be steamrolling along at 34,000 miles per hour, and it is quite alarming that our best scientists cannot tell us accurately exactly how close this asteroid will come.  The following comes from <a title="NBC News" href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Astronomers-Not-Sure-How-Close-Asteroid-Will-Come-to-Earth--369749361.html" target="_blank">NBC News</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="paragraph" data-pnum="1">An asteroid traveling <strong>about 34,000 miles per hour</strong> is expected to whiz past Earth on March 7. Astronomers are confident the warehouse-sized space rock will not impact the planet, but at the same time are not sure exactly how close it will come.</p>
<p class="paragraph" data-pnum="2">“<strong>It could be as close as 20,000 miles or as far as 10 million miles, so it’s a pretty big window</strong>,” astronomer Gerald McKeegan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would definitely agree with McKeegan.</p>
<p>That is quite a big window.</p>
<p>Hopefully the experts are correct and it poses no threat to us.  Because just imagine how much damage a 100 foot rock could do if it was dropped from space into a populated area at 34,000 miles an hour.  Here is an excerpt from a different news report <a title="about this incoming asteroid" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29544877/100-foot-asteroid-zoom-past-earth-two-weeks" target="_blank">about this incoming asteroid</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="mn_Global"><span id="MNGiSection">This one, known as 2013 TX68, is larger than an 18-wheel tractor trailer truck, and is expected to fly as close as 19,245 miles to Earth at 4:06 pm Pacific time on Monday, March 7. For comparison, that’s less than one-tenth as far as the moon is from Earth, or 238,900 miles.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global"><span id="MNGiSection">“<strong>It’s gonna be close</strong>. But it’s going to miss us. There is nothing to worry about,” said Gerald McKeegan, an astronomer at Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And of course the truth is that the Earth is being bombarded by objects from space all the time.  Approximately 40 tons of rock and dust hits our planet each day, and the vast majority of it burns up in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>But there are thousands upon thousands of larger objects that do present a significant threat to our civilization, and they are whizzing past us all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, a meteor that nobody saw coming crashed into the Atlantic Ocean back on February 6th.  The following comes from <a title="the Daily Mail" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3459057/Largest-fireball-Chelyabinsk-falls-Earth-Nasa-reports-huge-explosion-seven-meter-space-rock-Atlantic.html" target="_blank">the Daily Mail</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>A huge fireball crashed into the Atlantic earlier this month – and went almost unseen.</p>
<p>The event took place on February 6 at 14:00 UTC when a meteor exploded in the air 620 miles (1,000km) off the coast of Brazil.</p>
<p>It released energy equivalent to 13,000 tons of TNT, which is the same as the energy used in the first atomic weapon that leveled Hiroshima in 1945.</p>
<p>This was the largest event of its type since the February 2013 fireball that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, leaving more than 1,600 people injured.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course nobody saw the very large asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013.  That giant space rock exploded in the air, destroying hundreds of buildings and injuring about a thousand people.  It has been estimated that it exploded with the force of 500,000 tons of TNT.  In other words, it was many times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>In addition, there was another very significant asteroid that nobody saw coming in advance that barely missed our planet last March.  Here is more from <a title="the Daily Mail" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3459057/Largest-fireball-Chelyabinsk-falls-Earth-Nasa-reports-huge-explosion-seven-meter-space-rock-Atlantic.html" target="_blank">the Daily Mail</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, Brian Cox said we are at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we’re not taking the threat seriously.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us,’ Professor Cox told DailyMail.com. In fact, the Earth had a ‘near-miss’ only a few months ago.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We didn’t see it,’ says the 46-year-old. ‘We saw it on the way out, but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out. These things happen.’</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The bus-sized asteroid, named 2014 EC, came within 38,300 (61,637km) miles of Earth in March – around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If 2013 TX68 were to hit us, it would do far, far more damage than the meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk did.</p>
<p>But NASA is telling us that there is no reason to be concerned.  They promise us that “<a title="no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years" href="http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/why-has-nasa-announced-that-a-meteor-is-not-going-to-hit-the-earth-in-september" target="_blank">no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years</a>“.  So they assure us that we can all just relax and quit wondering about the thousands of giant space rocks that are hurtling toward us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NASA has established a “<a title="Planetary Defense Coordination Office" href="http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/nasa-establishes-a-planetary-defense-coordination-office-that-will-track-meteors-headed-toward-earth" target="_blank">Planetary Defense Coordination Office</a>” that will be in charge of tracking giant space rocks and is working to develop a way to destroy incoming asteroids <a title="using nuclear weapons" href="http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/why-is-nasa-working-on-a-way-to-destroy-asteroids-using-nuclear-weapons" target="_blank">using nuclear weapons</a>.</p>
<p>So why is NASA going to so much effort and spending so much tax money on these things if there is no threat?</p>
<p>Could it be possible that they know something that they aren’t telling us?</p>
<p>Or is it what they don’t know that scares them?</p>
<p>Without a doubt, I certainly hope that the scientists are correct and that an asteroid is not going to hit us on March 7th.</p>
<p>But scientists also tell us that it is inevitable that someday there will be a major impact.</p>
<p>When that time comes, will our scientists see the asteroid in advance?</p>
<p>And if they do, will they warn everyone, or will the government want to keep things quiet so not to create panic?

<p><i>You identified two problems but do not propose any solutions to either one; and you missed the two real problems.</i></p>
<p><b>This open letter from a young customer support employee of Yelp in San Francisco to her CEO has garnered a variety of comments that display a common bifurcation:</b> some are sympathetic to her struggle to get by in a very costly region on a modest salary, while others wonder if the letter is an <i>Onion</i> parody of clueless entitlement: <a href="https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a#.6m8h6gx9z" target="_blank">An Open Letter to My CEO</a>.</p>
<p><b>I am sympathetic to anyone who arrives in a very competitive &#8220;big city&#8221; with no local contacts and not a lot of experience or specialized training.</b> That describes me when I arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area a few decades ago.</p>
<p>My B.A. is in philosophy, which has a similar market value to your degree in English, i.e. near-zero. But this doesn&#8217;t mean my training in philosophy has no value; it simply means you can&#8217;t walk up to a potential employer and say, &#8220;Hi, I have a degree in philosophy, hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The value is only reaped by <i>applying what you have learned</i>.</b> Studying philosophy taught me a number of specific analytic skills: to seek out false assumptions and identify problems and potential solutions. If you can&#8217;t frame the problem accurately and coherently, it&#8217;s impossible to identify any useful solutions.</p>
<p><b>These skills have served me well, despite my &#8220;worthless&#8221; degree.</b> Though nobody had any sound reason to pay me a lot of money simply because I had a B.A. in philosophy, life presents a constant flow of problems that need to be analyzed in ways that enable the development of solutions.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a super-abundance of opportunities to <i>apply what I learned.</i><b>Taking my own experience as an employee, employer, business owner and entrepreneur,</b> I&#8217;ve condensed what I&#8217;ve learned about creating value (i.e. earnings) and the emerging <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1497533406?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=sheeple-embd-20&amp;creativeASIN=1497533406">economy into a book</a>.</p>
<p>It is less a career-guidance book and more of an explanation of how the economy actually works. It covers the eight essential skills you need to successfully navigate the economy <i>as it is, not as we wish it was</i>.</p>
<p>Rather than tell you the book is useful, I&#8217;ll apply what&#8217;s in it.</p>
<p><b>I don&#8217;t think your age, gender, ethnicity, etc. is relevant.</b> Anyone can apply what I&#8217;m sharing.</p>
<p><b>You have identified what you perceive as your two big problems:</b> the cost of living in the S.F. Bay Area is very high, and your pay is too modest to enable the lifestyle you anticipated/expected.</p>
<p><b>You identified these two problems but do not propose any solutions to either one; and you missed the two real problems.</b> Problems don&#8217;t solve themselves; problem-solving requires analysis, diligence and a willingness to learn from others, to experiment and fail&#8211;not once, but continually.</p>
<p><b>You did not identify the third problem: your expectations are completely mis-aligned with reality.</b> The S.F. Bay Area is one of the most attractive, stimulating, dynamic urban regions in the world, and it attracts capital and talent from all over the globe.</p>
<p>The demand to live and work here outstrips the supply of dwellings and high-paying jobs, so the costs of living are very high and the pay for labor is low unless you&#8217;re able to take advantage of specific skills or social contacts.</p>
<p>Many of the people who come here seeking work are highly educated, experienced, creative, ambitious, hard-working, dedicated, etc., and many possess enviable social skills (social capital).</p>
<p>If you intend to find work here (i.e. if you don&#8217;t have a large monthly income from a trust fund), you will be competing against extremely competitive, ambitious people, many of whom focus not on the hardships but on the opportunities. Expecting to outcompete these people for a high-paying job is unrealistic unless you have competitive skills, a strong work ethic, abundant social and human capital, etc.</p>
<p><b>Whatever you lack, you will have to acquire in order to be competitive in this environment.</b></p>
<p>If you want a degree that opens doors, earn a PhD in EE/CS from UC Berkeley or Stanford, or get top marks in your Stanford/Haas School (UCB) MBA program.</p>
<p>For the rest of us mere mortals, credentials don&#8217;t offer much advantage, as this is one of the most over-credentialed locales on the planet.</p>
<p><b>The question is: what can you do to create value?</b> It&#8217;s not so much a matter of having job skills or experience; it&#8217;s how those can be applied to create value&#8211;either for your employer or for your own enterprise.</p>
<p><b>So the real problem you have is: what can you do to increase your value creation and thus your earnings?</b> &#8220;Unfair&#8221; doesn&#8217;t count. Labor has a market value, end of story. Unfortunately, there is an oversupply of labor around the world and a scarcity of high-paying jobs.</p>
<p>It may seem like there is an abundance of high-paying jobs in the Bay Area because we&#8217;re in the bubble factory of the world, but this is only a reflection of frothy VC-fueled valuations of zero-profit companies and highly paid employees&#8217; ability to make their employers obscene amounts of money.</p>
<p>If you want to earn $100,000, you need to bring in $500,000 in revenues for your employee, minimum.</p>
<p><b>The second problem you have is: what can you do to dramatically lower your cost of living?</b> Since you didn&#8217;t properly identify the actual problems, you were incapable of finding solutions. Now that we&#8217;ve identified your real problems, we can seek solutions.</p>
<p><b>As for living costs: your goal should be to live on one of your two paychecks a month:</b> $733. Immigrants often get by on low-paying jobs and yet manage to buy a house and pay the mortgage off in five years. They do this by sharing expenses. If you want a very low-cost lifestyle, try befriending immigrants in your social circle (or add them to your circle). Someone will likely know someone in their extended group who has a room for rent (in a house they&#8217;re buying by pooling six adults&#8217; modest wages).</p>
<p>As for food&#8211;shop only in Chinatown or ethnic markets. If you are careful and observe what the older ladies are buying, you will not be able to carry $20 of groceries. Just recently, I bought two pounds of beautiful tangerines for $1 in Chinatown and wonderfully fresh <i>yao-choy</i> veggies for less than $2. Many fish are available for $2 or $3 a pound; if you&#8217;re vegan, pressed tofu is a cheap substitute for meat. Asian-style cooking only uses a few ounces of meat/meat substitute anyway.</p>
<p>A carton of black beans used for seasoning (it adds <i>umami</i>) will cost you $1.29, and last you a year. A jar of chili bean sauce (a teaspoon enlivens a dish most wonderfully) costs $2.29.</p>
<p><b>You get the point: learn to cook vegetable-based meals and your costs to eat gourmet food will drop under $100 per month.</b> A pound of beans and some Asian veggies will feed you for a week, and with some cheap seasoning, it will be delicious.</p>
<p>We eat better at home for $150 than people who spend $2,000 a month eating out. Anybody can learn how to cook with low-cost ingredients on YouTube University. Make a pot of spicy dal, experiment.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have any family to share expenses with, form a family-type group of responsible, honest friends. Rent a house with them, make some basic good-neighbor rules, and kick out whomever fails to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. It will be good experience for running your own enterprise.</p>
<p><b>Here is my version of a letter you could have sent Yelp&#8217;s CEO:</b></p>
<p><i>Dear CEO:</i></p>
<p><i>I know you&#8217;re busy, but I have two ideas that will immediately lower the costs of providing customer support while boosting productivity and employee retention.</i></p>
<p><i>After three months in customer support, I&#8217;ve observed that a few employees have developed ways to handle customer issues quickly and with relatively few coupons. Others solve customer issues by throwing coupons at everyone.</i></p>
<p><i>I&#8217;ve developed a brief, concise training program that would give every customer support employee the tools to resolve customer problems more efficiently and at lower cost than the present system.</i></p>
<p><i>If customer support teams were able to earn bonuses based on their improved productivity and lower costs, this would immediately improve employee retention, at a modest cost that would be more than paid for by higher productivity.</i></p>
<p><i>The benefits from these two ideas would be immediate. I am hoping you can get me fifteen minutes with the V.P. of customer support to present my training/productivity ideas, and I&#8217;m excited by the possibility that we could make dramatic improvements with a modest investment of time and virtually no capital costs.</i><br />
<i>Sincerely,</i><br />
<i>Yelp Employee</i><br />
<i>cc: V.P. of customer support</i></p>
<p><b>Which letter do you think would be more effective in accomplishing your goal of earning more money&#8211;your letter or my letter?</b> As management guru Peter Drucker noted, businesses don&#8217;t have profits, they only have expenses. <i>Value creation</i> boils down to cutting costs, boosting revenues and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>This is as true of a sole proprietorship as it is of a major corporation.</p>
<p>If the management of Yelp failed to show interest in your letter/proposal and did not even hear you out, you learned a very important lesson:</p>
<p><b>Yelp&#8217;s management is incompetent and/or dysfunctional, and there is no opportunity for you at Yelp.</b> This new knowledge clarifies your solution: find a job at a company/agency that is open to new ideas and is thus a place where you might be able to contribute value and grow your own human/social capital&#8211;and your earnings.</p>
<p><b>If you want to be in PR/media, start designing media/PR campaigns for small businesses for free.</b> Most won&#8217;t have any social media exposure; they will welcome your efforts to boost their revenues/customer base.</p>
<p>This is your job from hour 41 (after your full-time gig) to hour 55. Convincing small businesses to give you, an inexperienced person with no track record, hard cash, will be difficult; convincing them to let you design and produce a social-media campaign and share any increase in revenues with you is a much easier sell, because you&#8217;re taking the risks: if the campaign flops, you earn nothing, and the business owner isn&#8217;t out any cash.</p>
<p>But you will have learned a lot by the time you run 10 or 20 such campaigns, and if you do a good job, are honest, forthright and do what you say you&#8217;re going to do, you&#8217;ll assemble a useful network of contacts that will lead to opportunities you cannot anticipate.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">by Aaron Dykes</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg just gave us a glimpse of a future – not just where virtual reality is center – but were the masses are put in a box and completely blinded by their own fancy and distraction&#8230; A place where only the oligarchs operate in the real world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eAJN45l7bqs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The day is coming when censorship means editing the world in real time – and dissent is merely blacklisted from reaching the millions (and billions) of people who will be 10x as immersed in their virtual reality world than they are today in their smart phones.</p>
<p>Tunnel vision syndrome will infect nearly everyone, and the age of walking zombies programmed with lies and distortions will rule.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s called oculus rift, and they&#8217;re about to make it as cheap and ubiquitous as possible.</p>
<p>It is a future where decisions are made by an elite few, and the people have less connection with their masters than ever before in history. In this dystopic future, the only escape they will promote to the masses will be inward, into a digital matrix of meaningless pleasure and fantasy.

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dollarphotoclub_75798425.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114227" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dollarphotoclub_75798425.jpg" alt="lies and propaganda on tv (retro effect)" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Most people who are aware and capable of thought have given up on what is called the “mainstream media.” The presstitutes have destroyed their credibility by helping Washington to lie—“Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction,” “Iranian nukes,” “Assad’s use of chemical weapons,” “Russian invasion of Ukraine,” and so forth. The “mainstream media” has also destroyed its credibility by its complete acceptance of whatever government authorities say about alleged “terrorist events,” such as 9/11 and Boston Marathon Bombing, or alleged mass shootings such as Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. Despite glaring inconsistencies, contradictions, and security failures that seem too unlikely to be believable, the “mainstream media” never asks questions or investigates. It merely reports as fact whatever authorities say.</p>
<p>The sign of a totalitarian or authoritarian state is a media that feels no responsibility to investigate and to find the truth, accepting the role of propagandist instead. The entire Western media has been in the propaganda mode for a long time. In the US the transformation of journalists into propagandists was completed with the concentration of a diverse and independent media in six mega-corporations that are no longer run by journalists.</p>
<p>As a consequence, thoughtful and aware people increasingly rely on alternative media that does question, marshall facts, and offers analysis in place of an unbelievable official story line.</p>
<p>The prime example is 9/11. Large numbers of experts have destroyed the official story that has no factual evidence in its behalf. However, even without the hard evidence that 9/11 truthers have provided, the official story gives itself away. We are supposed to believe that a few Saudi Arabians with no technology beyond box cutters and no support from any government’s intelligence service were able to outwit the massive surveillance technology created by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and NSA (National Security Agency) and deal the most humiliating blow to a superpower ever delivered in human history. Moreover, they were able to do this without the President of the United States, the US Congress, and the “mainstream media” demanding accountability for such a total failure of the high-tech national security state. Instead of a White House led investigation of such a massive security failure, the White House resisted for more than one year any investigation whatsoever until finally giving in to demands from 9/11 families that could not be bought off and agreeing to a 9/11 Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission did not investigate but merely sat and wrote down the story told to it by the government. Afterwards, the Commission’s chairman, co-chairman, and legal counsel wrote books in which they said that information was withheld from the Commission, that the Commission was lied to by officials of the government, and that the Commission “was set up to fail.” Despite all of this, the presstitutes still repeat the official propaganda, and there remain enough gullible Americans to prevent accountability.</p>
<p>Competent historians know that false flag events are used to bring to fruition agendas that cannot otherwise be achieved. 9/11 gave the neoconservatives, who controlled the George W. Bush administration, the New Pearl Harbor that they said was necessary in order to launch their hegemonic military invasions of Muslim countries. The Boston Marathon Bombing permitted a trial run of the American Police State, complete with shutting down a large American city, putting 10,000 armed troops and SWAT teams on the streets where the troops conducted house to house searches forcing the residents out of their homes at gunpoint. This unprecedented operation was justified as necessary in order to locate one wounded 19 year old man, who clearly was a patsy.</p>
<p>There are so many anomalies in the Sandy Hook story that it has generated a cottage industry of skeptics. I agree that there are anomalies, but I don’t have the time to study the issue and come to my own conclusion. What I have noticed is that we are not given many good explanations of the anomalies. For example, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaHtxlSDgbk" target="_blank">this video made from the TV news coverage</a>, the video’s creator makes a case that the person who is the grieving father who lost his son is the same person outfitted in SWAT clothes at Sandy Hook following the shooting. The person is identified as a known actor. Now, it seems to me that this is easy to test. The grieving father is known, the actor is known, and the authorities have to know who the SWAT team member is. If these three people, who can pass for one another, can be assembled in one room at the same time, we can dismiss the expose claimed in this one video. However, if three separate people cannot be produced together, then we must ask why this deception, which raises questions about the entire story. You can watch the entire video or just skip to the 9:30 mark and observe what appears to be the same person in two different roles.</p>
<p>The “mainstream media” has the ability to make these simple investigations, but does not. Instead, the “mainstream media” calls skeptics “conspiracy theorists.”</p>
<p>There is a book by Professor Jim Fetzer and Mike Palecek that says Sandy Hook was a FEMA drill to promote gun control and that no one died at Sandy Hook. The book was available on amazon.com but was suddenly banned. Why ban a book?</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://rense.com/general96/nobodydied.html" target="_blank">free download of the book</a>: I have not read the book and have no opinion. I do know, however, that the police state that America is becoming certainly has a powerful interest in disarming the public. I also heard today a news report that people said to be parents of the dead children are bringing a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer, which is consistent with Fetzer’s claim.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-W3rIEe-ag" target="_blank">Buzzsaw interview with Jim Fetzer</a>: If the information Fetzer provides is correct, clearly the US government has an authoritarian agenda and is using orchestrated events to create a false reality for Americans in order to achieve the agenda.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Fetzer’s facts can be easily checked. If his facts check out, then a real investigation is required. If his facts do not check out, the official story gains credibility as Fetzer is one of the most energetic skeptics.</p>
<p>Fetzer cannot be dismissed as a kook. He graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from Princeton University, has a Ph.D. from Indiana University and was Distinguished McKnight University Professor at the University of Minnesota until his retirement in 2006. He has had a National Science Foundation fellowship, and he has published more than 100 articles and 20 books on philosophy of science and philosophy of cognitive science. He is an expert in artificial intelligence and computer science and founded the international journal <em>Minds and Machines</em>. In the late 1990s, Fetzer was asked to organize a symposium on philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>For an intelligent person, the official stories of President Kennedy’s assassination and 9/11 are simply not believable, because the official stories are not consistent with the evidence and what we know. Fetzer’s frustration with less capable and less observant people increasingly shows, and this works to his disadvantage.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if the authorities behind the official Sandy Hook story are secure with the official story, they would jump on the opportunity to confront and disprove Fetzer’s facts. Moreover, somewhere there must be photographs of the dead children, but, like the alleged large number of recordings by security cameras of an airliner hitting the Pentagon, no one has ever seen them. At least not that I know of.</p>
<p>What disturbs me is that no one in authority or in the mainstream media has any interest in checking the facts. Instead, those who raise awkward matters are dismissed as conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Why this is damning is puzzling. The government’s story of 9/11 is a story of a conspiracy as is the government’s story of the Boston Marathon Bombing. These things happen because of conspiracies. What is at issue is: whose conspiracy? We know from Operation Gladio and Operation Northwoods that governments do engage in murderous conspiracies against their own citizens. Therefore, it is a mistake to conclude that governments do not engage in conspiracies.</p>
<p>One often hears the objection that if 9/11 was a false flag attack, someone would have talked.<br />
Why would they have talked? Only those who organized the conspiracy would know. Why would they undermine their own conspiracy?</p>
<p>Recall William Binney. He developed the surveillance system used by NSA. When he saw that it was being used against the American people, he talked. But he had taken no documents with which to prove his claims, which saved him from successful prosecution but gave him no evidence for his claims. This is why Edward Snowden took the documents and released them. Nevertheless, many see Snowden as a spy who stole national security secrets, not as a whistleblower warning us that the Constitution that protects us is being overthrown.</p>
<p>High level government officials have contradicted parts of the 9/11 official story and the official story that links the invasion of Iraq to 9/11 and to weapons of mass destruction. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta contradicted Vice President Cheney and the official 9/11 story timeline. Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill has said that overthrowing Saddam Hussein was the subject of the first cabinet meeting in the George W. Bush administration long before 9/11. He wrote it in a book and told it on CBS News’ 60 Minutes. CNN and other news stations reported it. But it had no effect.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers pay a high price. Many of them are in prison. Obama has prosecuted and imprisoned a record number. Once they are thrown in prison, the question becomes: “Who would believe a criminal?”</p>
<p>As for 9/11 all sorts of people have talked. Over 100 police, firemen and first responders have<br />
reported hearing and experiencing a large number of explosions in the Twin Towers. Maintanence personnel report experiencing massive explosions in the sub-basements <em>prior to the building being hit by an airplane</em>. None of this testimony has had any effect on the authorities behind the official story or on the presstitutes.</p>
<p>There are 2,300 architects and engineers who have written to Congress requesting a real investigation. Instead of the request being treated with the respect that 2,300 professionals deserve, the professionals are dismissed as “conspiracy theorists.”</p>
<p>An international panel of scientists have reported the presence of reacted and unreacted nanothermite in the dust of the World Trade Centers. They have offered their samples to government agencies and to scientists for confirmation. No one will touch it. The reason is clear. Today science funding is heavily dependent on the federal government and on private companies that have federal contracts. Scientists understand that speaking out about 9/11 means the termination of their career.</p>
<p>The government has us where it wants us—powerless and disinformed. Most Americans are too uneducated to be able to tell the difference between a building falling down from asymetrical damage and one blowing up. Mainstream journalists cannot question and investigate and keep their jobs. Scientists cannot speak out and continue to be funded.</p>
<p>Truth telling has been shoved off into the alternative Internet media where I would wager the government runs sites that proclaim wild conspiracies, the purpose of which is to discredit all skeptics.</p>
